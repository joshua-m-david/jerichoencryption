					<h2>Enforce your right to privacy</h2>
					<p>
						In the wake of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying">NSA spying revelations</a> it is clear that 
						none of our communications are secure any longer. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsa">NSA</a> 
						is actively monitoring, collecting, 
						<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security">decrypting</a> and 
						<a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/">indefinitely storing</a> 
						the whole world's communications as it transits their networks. Any traffic passing through 
						any of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement">Five Eyes</a> countries (US, UK, Canada, 
						Australia and NZ) is monitored, collected and stored indefinitely. Any and all of your internet 
						traffic, phone calls, email, chat messages and anything else are vulnerable to the Five Eyes spy 
						agencies. This is no longer conspiracy theory, it is actually happening.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a massive breach of international human rights and it is an attack on the liberty, freedom and 
						privacy of every person on the planet. It has huge implications for our democracy, freedom of the press, 
						attorney-client privilege and freedom of speech. The 
						<a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> states clearly:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Article 3:</b> Everyone has the right to life, <i>liberty</i> and security of person.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Article 12:</b> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his <i>privacy</i>, 
							family, home or <i>correspondence</i>, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the 
							right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						It is time to enforce your right to privacy by using encryption the spies can never crack.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="introducing-jericho-encryption">Introducing Jericho Comms</h2>
					<p>
						Jericho Comms is an encrypted group text communications program which provides 
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theoretic_security">information-theoretic security</a> 
						for all messages that are sent and received.

						The goal is to deliver a high assurance, encrypted communications program with 
						plausible deniability for activists, human rights lawyers, 
						journalists, whistleblowers and citizens of the world that need high assurances that their 
						communications are free of censorship, control and eavesdropping from the world's 
						governments and intelligence agencies.

						To defeat the world's top intelligence agencies, citizens of every country need to raise 
						their communications security to a level where no-one can ever hope to break the encryption, 
						regardless of advances in computing power, cryptanalysis, mathematics or quantum physics.
					</p>
					<p>
						To accomplish this goal, the program uses a 
						True Random Number Generator (TRNG), the One-Time Pad (OTP) cipher for message encryption 
						and a one-time Message Authentication Code (MAC) for message authenticity.

						To provide additional protection of the one-time pad database during the 
						initial key exchange between users, a strong password/passphrase and 
						keyfile can be used. The program will then use a cascade of password Key Derivation Functions
						(KDFs), stream ciphers and MACs to encrypt and authenticate the database.

						Other features of the program include a strong MAC for authentication between the clients 
						and the server, a decoy messaging system to frustrate 
						traffic analysis and a self destruct mechanism which can wipe all the client databases in case 
						of an emergency.
					</p>
					<p>
						One-time pads are not frequently used outside of government and military networks because 
						they are somewhat inconvenient to use. This means they have generally only been reserved for 
						truly important communications such as the highest-level Allied communications in World War II
						or the Washington-Moscow hotline.

						The main problems are that you need to collect a lot of truly random data and the one-time 
						pads must be exchanged through a secure channel (e.g. delivered in person) before 
						communication can take place. These are not insurmountable problems and the design of this 
						software solves the main issues which make using one-time pads too impractical. The whole 
						system is very simple to set up and use, including generating truly random key material, 
						exchanging the one-time pads securely, key management and communicating securely.

						The program itself can be downloaded from the project's website 
						and the full source code, which is available on GitHub, 
						is released under the General Public License Version 3.0.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2>What about other types of encryption?</h2>
					<p>
						Most companies and organisations worldwide are using 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_B_Cryptography">Suite B Cryptography</a> algorithms 
						which have been publically published by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nist">NIST</a> for security of 
						<a href="http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/1989_NIST/NSA_Memorandum_of_Understanding">unclassified, non-military government networks</a>. 
						This has led most other governments, companies and individuals worldwide to adopt these standards thinking 
						that if they are secure for the government then they must be secure for them too. In 
						<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html?ref=us">this NSA leak</a> 
						we see privileged, top secret information that the NSA's real plan has <i>actually</i> been to covertly influence 
						these encryption policies, designs, standards and specifications to make them amenable to advanced 
						cryptanalytic capabilities of the NSA and exploitable through their signals intelligence collection network 
						with prior knowledge of the modification. The aim being that everyone in the world believes their systems' 
						are secure, but in reality, and only known to the NSA, their systems are exploitable. A lot of software 
						projects and companies <i>still</i> do not understand this and continue to use standards from the NIST. 
						This gives them and their users a false sense of security that their systems are secure from the NSA. 
					</p>
					<p>
						There has been evidence of <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~eroberts/cs201/projects/ethics-of-surveillance/tech_encryptionbackdoors.html">one</a> 
						encryption standard that was found to contain an NSA backdoor. It is absolutely na√Øve to assume 
						this was the only standard that was compromised in the 25 years that the Memorandum of Understanding between 
						NIST and NSA has existed. Some reputable cryptographers 
						<a href="http://safecurves.cr.yp.to">have already found problems</a> with the NIST's elliptic curve standards. 
						The truth is, any NIST/NSA standard could be subtly compromised in ways unbeknownst to the public cryptography 
						community. 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard#NSA.27s_involvement_in_the_design">In the 1970s</a> 
						the NSA made tweaks to S-Boxes to help strengthen the DES standard, but no-one at the time understood why. 
						It took public cryptographers another <i>two decades</i> to discover differential cryptanalysis. It is highly 
						likely the NSA are still years ahead of the public cryptography community in the area of cryptanalysis. What 
						we think is secure today may not actually be secure at all when trying to protect communications from  
						the NSA.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, <u>none</u> of the cryptography algorithms being generally used today 
						(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29">RSA</a>, 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Hellman_key_exchange">DH</a>, 
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>, 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha2">SHA2</a> etc) are actually <i>mathematically proven</i> 
						to be unbreakable and the ciphers are not 
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theoretic_security">information-theoretically secure</a>. 
						They are thought to be secure because they involve methods that assume solving a particular problem e.g. 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">integer factorization</a> or 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm">discrete logarithms</a> is hard and would 
						require long periods of time and/or large amounts of computing power to crack the encryption. When people 
						say that an algorithm like AES is secure, it is usually followed by the reasoning that a lot of smart 
						people have tried to break AES and have not succeeded. This is the na√Øve logic that leads the public to 
						use weak ciphers and allow the NSA/GCHQ to break all of the world's communications. It's easy to forget 
						that the <a href="http://www.math.uh.edu/~tomforde/Web/Jobs.html">NSA employs</a> the <i>smartest</i> 
						mathematicians and cryptographers. Also that those smart cryptanalysts are <i>not</i> 
						obligated to publish their results in cryptanalysis due to non-disclosure agreements with the 
						NSA as a condition of their employment. Also the yearly 
						<a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/inside-the-2013-us-intelligence-black-budget/420/#document/p16/a117323">multi-billion dollar black budgets</a> 
						they devote to breaking cryptography including 
						<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-seeks-to-build-quantum-computer-that-could-crack-most-types-of-encryption/2014/01/02/8fff297e-7195-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html">developing a quantum computer</a>. 
						Also the standards themselves 
						<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html?ref=us">being deliberately weakened</a> 
						by the NSA.
						Also that the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-crypto-breakthrough/">NSA are <i>years</i> ahead in cryptanalysis</a>. 
						Also that there is <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bild-1010361-793640.html">confirmed proof</a> 
						that the NSA have in-house (non-public) techniques to crack block ciphers like AES. 
						With all this in mind, how then is the qualification that the "world's best" public 
						cryptographers cannot break a particular algorithm <i>any</i> assurance of security against the 
						NSA?
					</p>
					<p>
						Why would you na√Øvely trust the US government's encryption standards that <i>they want you to use</i>, 
						especially when they have shown their duplicity and are running a mass surveillance system in secret?
					</p>
					
					
					<h2>Project status</h2>
					<p>
						Currently the program is fully functional and usable on PCs. However it is still in active 
						research and development to try and cover off a broad spectrum of security threats such as traffic 
						fingerprinting and targeted attacks that the NSA may be able to deploy against users of the 
						program. There are also ideas and functionality in development to make it usable on various 
						platforms e.g. tablets and mobile devices. It is hoped that users, developers, security 
						researchers and cryptographers will provide additional ideas and security analysis so the 
						software can be improved and made useful for everyone.
					</p>
					<p>
						We hope that with the concepts and designs used in this software, we can prove that using one-time pads 
						<i>is</i> actually a viable option outside of classified government and military networks. We hope that 
						this project enlightens other developers to create other solutions using one-time pads. We have 
						already seen new one-time pad based software being developed which was inspired by this project. 
						We hope to discourage users from using the US government's compromised encryption standards that 
						everyone else is using. We hope to encourage users to use well written, tested, security reviewed 
						open source software and hardware.
					</p>
					<p>
						As with any security software you should verify the software yourself and read the code to make sure it 
						does not contain any problems. With this software you can run it live in the browser and step through the 
						code line by line with Firebug or any of the tools built into your web browser. As you will see it should 
						work exactly as described <a href="information.html">in the documentation</a>. A lot of the heavy lifting 
						e.g. cryptographic hashing has been done in a few trusted external libraries, the outputs of which have 
						been verified against the specification documents. The aim is not to "roll-your-own" cryptography, but use 
						algorithms from trusted authors and proven unbreakable ciphers like the one-time pad to bring a secure 
						solution together. One-time pads are one of the simplest ciphers to implement compared to modern encryption 
						standards (elliptic curves, RSA, AES or block ciphers), which often requires a lot of knowledge in 
						mathematics. This means it is less likely to get the implementation wrong, compromising security through 
						timing and other side channel attacks.
					</p>
					<p>						
						Feedback can be discussed <a href="https://github.com/joshua-m-david/jerichoencryption">on Github</a>. 
						You are free to discuss the program, possible features, installation issues, security issues, encryption, 
                        privacy and anti-surveillance techniques there. There is also 
                        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uncrackable">a specific subreddit</a> 
                        which focusses on information theoretic security research and development (e.g. one-time pads).
					</p>					
					<p>
						A road map of future improvements can be found <a href="https://github.com/joshua-m-david/jerichoencryption">on Github</a>. 
						For the next phase of the project we will be adding a responsive version for mobile devices. After that we 
						have some other ideas and we can potentially look into securing file transfers, phone calls and other 
						communications.
					</p>
					<p>
                        Developers with skills in other languages (e.g. <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>) 
                        could consider developing secure client alternatives for other platforms using the current design 
                        and software as a reference implementation.
					</p>
