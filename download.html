					<h1>Download</h1>
					<p>
						The following links have been provided to download the software. All downloads contain the source code, 
						which is all that is needed to run the program. In the event of this site being taken down, which may 
						eventually happen, you can still find the files by searching on <a href="https://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a>. 
						For now, software questions, feedback and suggestions can be made 
						<a href="https://github.com/joshua-m-david/jerichoencryption/issues">on GitHub</a>.
					</p>
					<h3 class="important">Important:</h3>
					<p>
						It is absolutely critical to verify the downloaded file with the GPG signature. This is 
						to prevent anyone from modifying the source code which could weaken/break the encryption and 
						then distributing those copies around the internet pretending to be the real thing. You can verify the 
						file integrity using the file hashes and with  
						<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/hash-calculator-to-get-compute-and-calculate-md5-and-sha1-file-checksum-or-hash-value/">tools for Windows</a> or
						<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/quickhash/">Linux</a>. You can verify the authenticity 
						of the file by verifying the GnuPG signature with 
						<a href="http://gpg4win.org">gpg4win</a> (Windows) or <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> (Linux). 
						<a href="installation-server.html#verify-signature">See this guide</a> for how to verify the signature.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please also see and verify our <a href="faq.html#warrant-canary">warrant canary</a> for each release using 
						the same GPG signature listed below.

					<h2 id="release1.5.1">Jericho Comms version 1.5.1 downloads (Windows, Linux and UNIX based systems)</h2>
					<p>
						This update mainly makes the client and server more resilent to attack and recovers automatically 
						from network dropouts or disconnections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This release may also be the last version before version 2.0 where the program will need to be converted 
                        to a single page application so that the one-time pads can be encrypted at all times in client 
                        side storage and decrypted only as needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of the changes will make it backwards incompatible with version 1.5. You will need to 
						replace the client code, the server code and generate new one-time pads. If you want to keep 
						using your existing one-time pads that you have already shared with your chat partners 
						and it is too much hassle to create and share new ones, then keep using version 1.5 for now. 
						Please make a request on the <a href="https://github.com/joshua-m-david/jerichoencryption/issues">GitHub issue list</a> 
						and we will prioritise creation of a small script to convert the one-time pads from 1.5 format 
						to 1.5.1.
					</p>
					<b>Changes in v1.5.1</b><br>
					<ul class="changeLog">
						<li>Made the client more resilient to network dropouts by automatically reconnecting and on continued failure it backs off exponentially.</li>
						<li>Added a <a href="information.html#failsafe-csprng">failsafe CSPRNG</a> for the clients in case there is a failure in the Web Crypto API or the browser.</li>
						<li>Strengthened the API code against timing attacks by adding randomness from /dev/urandom into each <a href="information.html#double-hmac-validation">Double HMAC validation</a> calculation.</li>
						<li>Changed the timing that other clients are considered as online from 3 minutes to 5 minutes.</li>
						<li>Made the main website responsive so it is more easily viewable on mobile devices.</li>
						<li>Added a list of references to the white paper and <a href="information.html">technical documentation</a> and improved the quality in general.</li>

					<h2 id="release1.5">Jericho Comms version 1.5 downloads (Windows, Linux and UNIX based systems)</h2>
					<p>
						There are quite a few large changes in this release which is why it has taken almost a year 
                        to develop. With the uncertainty surrounding 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#End_of_life_announcement">the future of Truecrypt</a>,
                        which was most likely a triggered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">warrant canary</a>, 
                        the main change in this release was the cascade encryption and authentication of the one-time pad database 
                        to protect the one-time pads with a strong passphrase they are transported. You should of course continue 
                        to use version 7.1a of TrueCrypt if you need the plausible deniability features that a hidden volume offers. 
                        TrueCrypt version 7.1a has had a reasonably clean bill of health 
                        <a href="http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/">after an audit of the code</a>.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Many of the changes will make it backwards incompatible with version 1.41. You will need to 
						replace the client code, the server code and generate new one-time pads. If you want to keep 
						using your existing one-time pads that you have already shared with your chat partners 
						and it is too much hassle to create and share new ones, then keep using version 1.41 for now. 
						Please make a request on the <a href="https://github.com/joshua-m-david/jerichoencryption/issues">GitHub issue list</a> 
						and we will prioritise creation of a small script to convert the one-time pads from 1.41 format 
						to 1.5.
					</p>
					<b>Changes in v1.5</b><br>
					<ul class="changeLog">
						<li>Renamed the program to Jericho Comms.</li>

						<li>The auto nuke command is now sent covertly via the secure and authenticated message channel rather than as a separate API request.</li>
						<li>Added desktop alert notifications for incoming chat messages so users can see they have a new message when the browser is not in focus.</li>
						<li>Base64 encoded the server protocol data packets in preparation of the next v2.0 release which will encrypt all meta data.</li>						
					</ul>
										
					
					<h2 id="release1.41">Jericho Chat version 1.41 downloads (Windows, Linux and Unix based systems)</h2>

						you to upload your own random data into the program, which is then split into multiple one-time pads 
						for use with the program.
					</p>
					<b>Changes in v1.4</b><br>
					<ul class="changeLog">
						<li>Modified <a href="information.html#trng-photo">photo TRNG</a> algorithm.</li>
						<li>Added ability to <a href="information.html#trng-custom">load custom random data</a> into the program.</li>
					</ul>
										
					
					<h2 id="release1.3">Jericho Chat version 1.3 downloads (Windows, Linux and Unix based systems)</h2>
					<p>
						This version has had a major overhaul of the code. Many of the changes will make it backwards incompatible 
						with version 1.2. You will need to replace the client code, the server code and generate new one-time pads. 
						If you want to keep using your existing one-time pads that you have already shared with your chat partners 
						and it is too much hassle to create and share new ones, then keep using version 1.2 for now. Please 
						make a request on the <a href="https://github.com/joshua-m-david/jerichoencryption/issues">GitHub issue list</a>

						<li>Removed HMAC in message authentication and the <a href="information.html#message-authentication">MAC now uses Skein or Keccak</a> in a secure construction.</li>
						<li>Reduced reliance on any NSA algorithms by removing SHA2 for message authentication.</li>
						<li><a href="information.html#message-encoding">Increased maximum message size</a> to 115 bytes/characters.</li>
						<li>Shortened the message length field and timestamp field.</li>
					</ul>
					
					
					<h2 id="release1.2">Jericho Chat version 1.2 downloads (Windows, Linux and Unix based systems)</h2>
					<b>Changes in v1.2</b><br>
