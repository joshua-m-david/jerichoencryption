						<h2 id="abstract"><span>1</span> Abstract</h2>						
						<p>
							This document describes the design of an end-to-end encrypted, group text communications 
							program which provides <a href="#ref25">information-theoretic security<sup>[25]</sup></a> 
							for all messages that are sent and received.
							
							The goal is to deliver a high assurance, encrypted communications program with 
							<a href="#ref34">plausible deniability<sup>[34]</sup></a> for activists, human rights lawyers, 
							journalists, whistleblowers and citizens of the world that need high assurances that their 
							communications are free of censorship, control and eavesdropping from the world's 
							governments and intelligence agencies.
							
							To defeat the world's top intelligence agencies, citizens of every country need to raise 
							their communications security to a level where no-one can ever hope to break the encryption, 
							regardless of advances in computing power, cryptanalysis, mathematics or quantum physics.
						</p>
						<p>
							To accomplish the program's design goals, the software uses a 
							<a href="#ref22">True Random Number Generator<sup>[22]</sup></a> (TRNG), the 
							<a href="#ref23">One-Time Pad<sup>[23]</sup></a> (OTP) cipher for message encryption 
							and a one-time <a href="#ref24">Message Authentication Code<sup>[24]</sup></a> (MAC) for 
							message authenticity.
							
							To provide additional protection of the one-time pad database during the 
							<a href="#ref26">initial key exchange<sup>[26]</sup></a> between users, a 
							strong <a href="#ref27">passphrase<sup>[27]</sup></a> and 
							<a href="#ref66">keyfile<sup>[66]</sup></a> can be used. The program will then use a cascade 
							of <a href="#ref28">Password Based Key Derivation Functions<sup>[28]</sup></a> (PBKDFs), 
							<a href="#ref29">stream ciphers<sup>[29]</sup></a> and MACs to encrypt and authenticate the 
							database.
							
							Other features of the program include a strong MAC for authentication between the clients 
							and the server, a decoy messaging system to frustrate 
							<a href="#ref65">traffic analysis<sup>[65]</sup></a> and a self 
							destruct mechanism which can wipe all the client databases in case of an emergency.
						</p>
						<p>
							One-time pads are not frequently used outside of government and military networks because 
							they are somewhat inconvenient to use. This means they have generally only been reserved for 
							truly important communications such as the 
							<a href="#ref64">highest-level Allied communications in World War II<sup>[64]</sup></a> 
							or the <a href="#ref30">Washington-Moscow hotline<sup>[30]</sup></a>. They are 
							still used by the US government where 
							<a href="#ref218">heavily armoured trucks transport random numbers to the Pentagon<sup>[218]</sup></a>.
							
							The main problems are that the user needs to collect a lot of truly random data and the 
							one-time pads must be exchanged through a secure channel, e.g. delivered in person, before 
							communication can take place. These are not insurmountable problems and the design of this 
							software solves the main issues which make using one-time pads too impractical. The whole 
							system is very simple to set up and use, including generating truly random key material, 
							exchanging the one-time pads securely, key management and communicating securely.
							
							The program itself can be <a href="#ref31">downloaded from the project's website<sup>[31]</sup></a> 
							and the full source code, which is available on <a href="#ref32">GitHub<sup>[32]</sup></a>, 
							is released under the <a href="#ref33">General Public License, Version 3.0<sup>[33]</sup></a>.

					<h2 id="introduction"><span>2</span> Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						In the wake of the <a href="#ref1">global surveillance disclosures<sup>[1]</sup></a> 
						(Snowden revelations) it has become apparent that the majority of our computer systems and 
						communications are no longer secure. The <a href="#ref2">NSA<sup>[2]</sup></a> and its spy 
						agency partners are actively <a href="#ref3">collecting<sup>[3]</sup></a> and 
						<a href="#ref4">storing<sup>[4]</sup></a> 
						the whole world's communications as it transits their networks. Any data passing through 
						the <a href="#ref5">Five Eyes<sup>[5]</sup></a> and partner countries (Australia, 
						Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, 
						Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States) is intercepted, 
						collected, decrypted and stored indefinitely. Internet traffic, phone calls, email, chat 
						messages and everything else are vulnerable to this international surveillance network. 
						<a href="#ref6">Edward Snowden describes<sup>[6]</sup></a> this network:
					</p>
					<cite>
						"The Five Eyes alliance is sort of an artifact of the post World War II era where the Anglophone 
						countries are the major powers banded together to sort of co-operate and share the costs of 
						intelligence gathering infrastructure... The result of this was over decades and decades some 
						sort of a supra-national intelligence organisation that doesn't answer to the laws of its own 
						countries."						
					</cite>
					<p>
						This spy network is a massive breach of international human rights and it is an attack on 
						the liberty, freedom and privacy of every person on the planet. It has huge implications 
						for democracy, freedom of the press, attorney-client privilege and freedom of speech. The 
						<a href="#ref7">Universal Declaration of Human Rights<sup>[7]</sup></a> states clearly:
					</p>
					<cite>
						<b>Article 3:</b> Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.
					</cite>
					<cite>
						<b>Article 12:</b> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, 
						family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the 
						right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
					</cite>
					<p>
						From the NSA leaks we know some of the NSA's capabilities for interception, collection, 
						<a href="#ref8">malware, hacking<sup>[8]</sup></a> and 
						<a href="#ref9">interdiction<sup>[9]</sup></a>. 
						However we know very little about the NSA's full cryptanalytic capability from the NSA leaks. 
						It is classed as <a href="#ref10">Exceptionally Compartmented Information (ECI)<sup>[10]</sup></a>, 
						which very few people have access to within the NSA. In other words, the information is available 
						only on a need to know basis. We can assume this is likely only their top cryptanalysts and 
						agency directors. This is similar to how the Enigma cipher was broken but the knowledge of this 
						was known only to a few and <a href="#ref11">kept secret for decades afterwards<sup>[11]</sup></a>. 
						Unfortunately Snowden did not have access to all their cryptanalytic capabilities 
						so we do not know what the NSA's true code breaking abilities are and which ciphers they 
						can break. <a href="#ref12">Edward Snowden once stated<sup>[12]</sup></a>:
					</p>
					<cite>
						"Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that 
						you can rely on."
					</cite>
					<p>
						However no-one can actually qualify that statement to say <i>which</i> encryption is actually 
						strong and which is not. Snowden never had access to the highly sensitive, compartmentalised 
						cryptanalysis information at the NSA in the first place. We are also unsure about which 
						standards that the NSA have compromised or weakened. We know that the 
						<a href="#ref13">Dual EC DRBG standard<sup>[13]</sup></a> and the 
						<a href="#ref14">NIST curves<sup>[14]</sup></a> appear very	suspect. However through their 
						control and manipulation of the <a href="#ref15">NIST<sup>[15]</sup></a> and 
						<a href="#ref16">IETF<sup>[16]</sup></a> standards it is entirely 
						possible that most public domain cryptography has been subtly influenced, weakened or corrupted 
						to some degree. To be protected from the NSA, it makes sense to take a conservative approach and 
						trust no single algorithm on its own. This means at a minimum using 
						<a href="#ref17">cascading ciphers and algorithms<sup>[17]</sup></a> to hedge against 
						the NSA exploiting flaws in the algorithms that 
						<a href="#ref18">only they know about<sup>[18]</sup></a>. In addition 
						to this it is important to use algorithms and best-practice knowledge from independent, reputable 
						cryptographers and security experts with no affiliation to the US government. It is even better if 
						these cryptographers are vocal with their criticisms about surveillance and government overreach such as 
						<a href="#ref19">Daniel J. Bernstein<sup>[19]</sup></a> or 
						<a href="#ref20">Bruce Schneier<sup>[20]</sup></a> so people can be assured they are not likely 
						to intentionally backdoor their algorithms.
					</p>
					<p>
						The main problem with public key cryptosystems currently in common use is that they are particularly 
						<a href="#ref35">vulnerable to quantum computers<sup>[35]</sup></a>. We know that the NSA are 
						<a href="#ref36">close to building one<sup>[36]</sup></a>. They will not make a public 
						announcement when they do get one and they may get one well before they become publicly 
						available, especially with their large budget of 
						<a href="#ref37">one billion USD per annum for cryptanalysis and exploitation services<sup>[37]</sup></a>.
						An <a href="#ref38">announcement from the NSA<sup>[38]</sup></a> in September 2015 has 
						recommended a plan to transition to quantum resistant algorithms in the very near future. Some 
						argue that this is a hint that they consider RSA or Elliptic Curve cryptography will be    
						<a href="#ref39">no longer safe to use<sup>[39]</sup></a><a href="#ref40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> 
						in the very near future. 
						Even with quantum safe public key algorithms there is no general consensus about 
						which algorithms are actually secure against quantum computers or what key sizes will be 
						sufficient. A lot more public cryptanalysis and research in the area of post quantum cryptography 
						really needs to be done before this becomes a viable option. 
						A <a href="#ref21">2008 paper<sup>[21]</sup></a> proposed a 
						large key size of 7,667,855 bits for a hypothetical 256 bit security level when using the 
						<a href="#ref41">McEliece cryptosystem<sup>[41]</sup></a>. Comparing that security level to the 
						design of this program and given an equal 7,667,855 bits of truly random data, this program 
						would split the data into separate one-time pads of 1536 bits each, achieving perfect secrecy 
						for 4992 chat messages at 115 bytes of plaintext per message. This is essentially a years worth 
						of communication with another person but the user gets proven information-theoretic security 
						instead of an unproven scheme.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another problem with public key cryptography is that to do it securely, users 
						need to meet and verify public key fingerprints in person. Verifying by voice over the phone 
						was once recommended, but <a href="#ref42">new research has shown<sup>[42]</sup></a> that given 
						a few audio samples of someone's voice, an attacker can use software that automates speech 
						synthesis to create a close duplicate of an individual's voice. The technology can then 
						transform the attacker's voice to say any message in the voice of the victim. With the 
						NSA in a privileged position on the Internet backbone, they could replace any  
						public key fetched over the Internet with one of their choosing using 
						<a href="#ref43">QUANTUMINSERT<sup>[43]</sup></a>. For example, if a source calls a journalist 
						to confirm the fingerprint of the public key they downloaded, the NSA can use voice synthesis 
						to confirm the fingerprint of the NSA's public key instead. With the source now encrypting to 
						the NSA's public key, this would allow the NSA to transparently perform a 
						<a href="#ref44">Man in the Middle attack<sup>[44]</sup></a> (MITM) on future communications 
						between the source and the journalist.
					</p>
					<p>
						Other methods of public key verification simply offload the trust responsibility to some other 
						mechanism, for example Certificate Authorities 
						<a href="#ref45">which have a multitude of problems<sup>[45]</sup></a><a href="#ref46"><sup>[46]</sup></a><a href="#ref47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> 
						and are not considered secure against nation state adversaries.
						If users need to meet physically to manually compare fingerprints to achieve reasonable security, 
						then it is no less difficult to exchange a small memory card full of one-time pads instead which 
						would allow communication for years into the future with perfect secrecy.
						
						With one-time pads, there is no fear, uncertainty or doubt about which algorithms are safe, which 
						key sizes are sufficient and which algorithms are truly safe from quantum computers. Users can 
						focus on operational security which is something they can realistically control, rather than 
						relying on unproven cryptographic algorithms and hoping that they are sufficiently secure 
						against an adversary such as the NSA.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a focus on ease of use, understanding, configuring and using this program is much easier 
						for the average user than complicated systems like <a href="#ref245">GnuPG<sup>[245]</sup></a>. 
						The only minor inconvenience is the key exchange before use. Everything else which is 
						complicated can be simplified and mostly automated using well written software and a well 
						designed user interface.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="advantages"><span>3</span> Advantages</h2>
					<p>
						Since the Snowden revelations starting in June 2013, there have been a number of secure messaging 
						solutions released. This software was one of the earliest counter-offensives to these revelations 
						with a fully functional prototype release in August 2013. This software has a number of 
						strong advantages compared to other secure messaging solutions whose designers have not accounted 
						for or understood the entire breadth and depth of the revelations. Most of them aim for mass 
						market, average grade security and do not adequately protect their users against the full 
						capabilities of the 
						<a href="#ref2">NSA<sup>[2]</sup></a>, <a href="#ref220">GCHQ<sup>[220]</sup></a> and 
						<a href="#ref221">TAO<sup>[221]</sup></a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The advantages of this software are:
					</p>
					<ul class="advantagesList">
						<li><b>Fully open source</b> &ndash; anyone can freely contribute, distribute, download, modify and use the software.</li>
						<li><b>Simple to understand and use</b> &ndash; anyone can use including journalists and novice computer users.</li>

						<li><b>Plausible deniability</b> &ndash; users under duress can provide a key that decrypts to a plausible message.</li>
						<li><b>Secure against quantum computers</b> &ndash; secure against future advances in physics and computing.</li>
						<li><b>Information-theoretically secure</b> &ndash; messages remain secure even against unlimited computing power.</li>
						<li><b>Automated decoy messages</b> &ndash; hides the real number of messages being sent across the network.</li>
						<li><b>Limited network metadata</b> &ndash; hinders traffic fingerprinting, analysis and automated remote exploits.</li>
						<li><b>Not wholly reliant on NIST</b> &ndash; standards are combined with algorithms from trusted cryptographers.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>
							The program uses a simple <a href="#ref49">star network<sup>[49]</sup></a> design. One particular 
							point about this client-server architecture is that the clients are the only devices which 
							have the one-time pads (encryption keys). The server effectively only contains encrypted 
							data. The clients operate on a request, response basis. Because of this, the clients 
							which have the sensitive encryption keys should have their firewalls configured to block <b>all</b> 
							incoming traffic by default and only receive incoming data as responses to outgoing requests 
							that they have specifically made to the server. The responses from the server are always 
							authenticated using a shared API Key and any malformed or unauthentic responses are immediately 
							discarded. This makes the client machines a lot more resilient to attack and exfiltration of 
							encryption keys. Assuming the client machines are single purpose and are not used for 
							untrusted web browsing or other activities this is a very small attack surface. To use it 
							on a multi-purpose machine, the program could be run in a virtual machine e.g. 
							<a href="#ref50">CubesOS<sup>[50]</sup></a> to limit the attack surface.
						</li>
						<li>
							The server should have a firewall as well which only allows incoming application data on one 
							port and optionally on an SSH port for management. The server application expects a correctly 
							authenticated packet from the client or it discards the request and responds with a 
                            <code>HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found</code> error. Of course there is the potential for a 
                            <a href="#ref51">0-day vulnerability<sup>[51]</sup></a> 
                            in the server application layers but compromising the server will not 
							compromise confidentiality or authenticity of messages as they are encrypted end-to-end. If 
							an attacker gained access to the server they could only interfere with the server's operations 
							to block messages from being sent or received at all.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					
					<h2 id="how-it-works"><span>6</span> How it works</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The first user will run a TRNG. They can use their own or the one included with the 
							software. This random data is then divided into separate one-time pads. It is possible to 
							generate enough data for a few thousand messages in under a minute. A few thousand messages 
							is enough for 6-12 months of communication at a reasonable frequency of messages sent per day.
						</li>
						<li>
							Each user will be assigned specific one-time pads for sending messages. This prevents re-use 
							of a pad by another user. Re-using a pad 
							<a href="#ref52">can make cryptanalysis possible<sup>[52]</sup></a> so it is 
							very important to prevent this. The messaging protocol is explained in depth further on.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once the one-time pads are generated, the program can export them for each user to encrypted 
							text files. These should be saved directly onto removable flash media such as MicroSD card, 
							SD card, USB thumbdrive, CD, DVD, Blu-Ray Disc or portable hard drive. The program requires 
							the one-time pad database to be encrypted and protected with a password.
							
							This adds additional protection so users do not need to securely erase the pads or physically 
							destroy the storage media after the one-time pads have been transferred, unless they have very 
							high security requirements. If the users need plausible deniability that they are even 
							carrying one-time pads in the first place then there are some other precautions such as 
							creating a hidden <a href="#ref53">TrueCrypt<sup>[53]</sup></a> volume on the storage media 
							first before copying the pads into it.
						</li>
						<li>
							To get the one-time pads to the other users, ideally they will arrange a physical meetup. 
							This is to create a <a href="#ref54">secure channel<sup>[54]</sup></a> or 
							<a href="#ref55">air gap<sup>[55]</sup></a> to deliver the one-time pads which ensures the 
							encryption keys are not intercepted or compromised by transferring them over an insecure 
							network like the Internet. Key exchange is the user's responsibility and the best method is 
							to hide in plain sight. There are a few solutions that will usually work:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Meeting the other user/s in person for a coffee, drink, lunch or dinner provides an 
									innocent cover for the exchange of encryption keys. If a user is going about their 
									daily activities this is the least suspicious option and the most likely to succeed.
								</li>
								<li>
									A <a href="#ref56">dead drop<sup>[56]</sup></a>. Arrange the time and place 
									of the dead drop in person or using another method, but do not arrange this over an 
									insecure channel.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the country a user is residing in does not inspect internal mail, a sealed 
									(tamperproof) courier envelope can be hand signed and sent with reasonable assurance 
									that it won't be compromised. If the package appears to be opened on delivery, the 
									encryption keys must be considered compromised and not used. International mail is 
									sometimes opened by <a href="#ref57">Customs<sup>[57]</sup></a> so it is not a 
									reliable method. It would not be difficult to hide an encrypted MicroSD within 
									something else though.
								</li>
								<li>
									Usually it is not difficult to get a laptop, portable hard drive, MicroSD card, or 
									SD card through Customs at national or international airports. Users can also hide 
									them in their carry-on luggage or on their person. If the government is allowed to scan 
									personal phones or computers as people are going through Customs then they may need 
									to use <a href="#ref59">steganography<sup>[59]</sup></a> to hide the one-time pads 
									within their vacation photos, videos or other files. If Customs request a closer 
									look at the contents of their devices by 
									<a href="#ref251">forcing them to disclose their passwords or encryption keys<sup>[251]</sup></a>, 
									then the user must keep an eye on exactly what they are doing and that the device is 
									visible at all times. If Customs take the device to an area where it is no longer 
									visible to the user, or they insert any other devices into the laptop such as a USB 
									drive, then they could have loaded malware onto it. These devices must then be 
									considered compromised and discarded.
								</li>
								<li>
									Governments and diplomats also have the option of using a 
									<a href="#ref60">diplomatic bag<sup>[60]</sup></a> to transfer items to 
									another country which have diplomatic immunity from search or seizure under the 
									<a href="#ref61">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations<sup>[61]</sup></a>.
								</li>
							</ul>
							The one-time pads absolutely cannot be sent via a less secure channel such as the Internet 
							even if using the best public key, block or stream cipher encryption there is. This reduces 
							the security to be only as strong as the cipher used and the 
							<a href="#ref62">perfect secrecy<sup>[62]</sup></a> that the one-time pad provides is lost.<br>
							<br>
							Some people complain about having to deliver the one-time pads physically as if this is some 
							impossible, arduous task. This line of thought is entirely devoid of reality. There is no 
							actual difficulty in storing some data on a portable memory stick and visiting someone in 
							person to give it to them.
						</li>
						<li>					
							As the one-time pads are in transit it is important to keep them secured on one's person at 
							all times. They should not be left anywhere unattended and kept in a zipped up pocket to 
							prevent pickpockets. Ideally they could have a <a href="#ref63">tamper evident<sup>[63]</sup></a> 
							seal as well.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once the one-time pads are safely delivered and the server is set up, each user will load them into 
							the program and begin chatting. There are extra security considerations listed further on but 
							it will be important to erase the text file containing the one-time pads from the removable 
							media once they are loaded into the program. Storing the one-time pads and running the 
							software from within an encrypted container on the removable media will help mitigate most 
							issues. <a href="#ref78">VeraCrypt / TrueCrypt<sup>[78]</sup></a> and portable 
							<a href="#ref79">Firefox<sup>[79]</sup></a> can be used for this. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					
					<h2 id="configuring-own-server"><span>7</span> Server configuration</h2>
					<p>
						The server basically functions as a temporary database store for the encrypted messages. One user leaves encrypted 
						messages on the server and the other users can retrieve them when they are able. If both users are 
						connected at the same time it is possible for real-time chat, plus or minus a few seconds. The messages 
						are removed immediately from the server after they are read by all users.
					</p>
					<p>
						The server is user owned and operated which means users are in complete control of the communications. 
						No-one else knows about the server so this keeps it off the radar of the intelligence agencies, as 
						opposed to having a central server somewhere that everyone on the Internet is using. If everyone was 
						using a single server it leaves it as a single point of failure and the intelligence agencies can 
						<a href="#ref80">raid it<sup>[80]</sup></a>, 
						<a href="#ref81">hack it<sup>[81]</sup></a> or 
						<a href="#ref82">shut it down<sup>[82]</sup></a> 
						with a court order. There is no useful data for them on the server but they would be able to shut 
						down a lot of user's of communications at once, at least until someone set up a new server.
					</p>
					<p>
						The server code provides a <a href="#ref83">REST<sup>[83]</sup></a> based 
						<a href="#ref84">API<sup>[84]</sup></a> using 
						<a href="#ref85">JSON<sup>[85]</sup></a> which will run on the 
						<a href="#ref86">Apache<sup>[86]</sup></a> 
						2.2+ web server, <a href="#ref87">MySQL<sup>[87]</sup></a> 5.5+ database and 
						<a href="#ref88">PHP<sup>[88]</sup></a> 5.3+ programming language. PHP was chosen 
						because it is a <a href="#ref89">memory safe<sup>[89]</sup></a> language, 
						fast to develop in and fast to deploy along with a basic 
						<a href="#ref90">LAMP stack<sup>[90]</sup></a>. In a future 
						version, the design may be ported to another server side language, database and web server that 
						are considered more secure. The straightforward JSON REST API interface should enable the client 
						to connect with multiple different backend code bases and users can implement the one of their 
						choosing.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the moment, to get the server side running all that is needed is to install a basic 
						LAMP stack, copy the server files over to the web root directory, run the database script to 
						create the tables, then finally edit the config 
						file with the server's database and API login credentials. An 
						<a href="#ref92">easy to use guide<sup>[92]</sup></a> with screenshots for 
						<a href="#ref91">Ubuntu server<sup>[91]</sup></a> has been created for this. Users can install 
						a server their own network, or pay for a cheap 
						<a href="#ref93">VPS<sup>[93]</sup></a> somewhere. It is not recommended 
						to use a VPS in the US to rule out the possibility of the provider being issued with a 
						<a href="#ref94">National Security Letter (NSL)<sup>[94]</sup></a> 
						which would compromise security of the server.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="server-authentication-protocol"><span>8</span> Server authentication protocol</h2>
					<p>
						A symmetric key based authentication protocol is used to securely authenticate the requests and 
						responses with the server API. This replaces TLS which secured the server API credentials 
						(username & password) in transit in versions up to 1.2. The reason for this was mainly to 
						simplify installation, 
						<a href="#ref46">avoid Certificate Authorities<sup>[46]</sup></a><a href="#ref47"><sup>[47]</sup></a><a href="#ref95"><sup>[95]</sup></a><a href="#ref96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>, 
						have resistance against active <a href="#ref97">MITM attacks<sup>[97]</sup></a> and 
						<a href="#ref36">quantum computers<sup>[36]</sup></a>. 
						There have also been major security problems with common TLS implementations such as 
						<a href="#ref98">OpenSSL<sup>[98]</sup></a>, 
						<a href="#ref99">GnuTLS<sup>[99]</sup></a> and 
						<a href="#ref100">iOS<sup>[100]</sup></a> which have led to a loss in confidence in these 
						programs which have poor code quality and may be hiding other NSA backdoors.
					</p>
					<h3 id="design-goals"><span>8.1</span> Design goals</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Authenticate all API requests to the server to verify they are from valid server users.
						</li>
						<li>
							Authenticate all API responses from the server to verify the response came from the legitimate 
							server, not an attacker.
						</li>
						<li>
							Mitigate passive MITM attacks where an attacker tries to steal the API credentials in transit.
						</li>
						<li>
							Mitigate active MITM attacks where an attacker attempts to send fake responses to/from the server or 
							impersonate the server.
						</li>
						<li>
							Mitigate replay attacks and reject any request/response if the data was modified in transit.
						</li>
						<li>
							Prevent a request to the server being modified by an attacker to perform a different API action.
						</li>
						<li>
							Mitigate quantum computer attacks on the protocol.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 id="limitations"><span>8.2</span> Limitations</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The server administrator will control the server and be a user of the chat group's operating on that 
							server as well. The server administrator will be a trustworthy person not interested in interfering 
							with his own chat group's communications. If a group of users want to communicate with each other, 
							but the server administrator is not included in that group, then they should set up their own server.
							This rules out the server administrator having the will to interfere with communications.
						</li>
						<li>
							Users of the server have an interest in keeping the shared API key on the server a secret to protect 
							their own communications so they will not give that key to anyone else.
						</li>
						<li>
							There is no need for each user having a separate API key on the server to send/receive requests 
							because the server administrator could access that key anyway and impersonate them or simply edit 
							the database record to alter which user the message came from.
						</li>
						<li>
							There is trust between the users in the group communicating not to impersonate other users in the 
							chat group. Because every user in a group has access to all the same one-time pads and same API key, 
							it would technically be possible to pretend to be one of the other users in the chat group. This also 
							doubles as a <a href="#ref101">deniable authentication<sup>[101]</sup></a> 
							protocol because every message sent could have been engineered to come from one of the other 
							users in the chat group.
						</li>
						<li>
							Encryption for the server protocol is not required because individual messages are encrypted using the 
							one-time pads and signed on each client machine. Some anonymised, non-critical meta-data is viewable 
							if an attacker in a privileged network position is passively watching the traffic. This may indicate 
							a chat conversation is taking place using this protocol. If this is a problem, the user can easily 
							add TLS to the connection and use a pinned certificate. Version 2.0 of the program will encrypt the connection 
							between the client and the server using a cascade stream cipher to hide the meta data and to avoid 
							relying on TLS. Hiding the meta data by sending only encrypted binary blobs between the client 
							and server will make traffic analysis and fingerprinting much more difficult for spy tools like 
                            <a href="#ref102">XKeyScore<sup>[102]</sup></a>. 
                            Without knowledge of the protocol being used this means automated hacking tools that 
							<a href="#ref103">TAO agents<sup>[103]</sup></a> use will not know whether a client machine 
							is running this program or any other program sending binary data. This lowers the likelihood 
							of them being able to target the client machines with a specific exploit for this program to 
							extract the one-time pads or tamper with them.
						</li>
						<li>
							The server protocol does not anonymise IP addresses from users connecting to the server. If 
							there is a requirement for anonymity, then users can tunnel their connection through a SOCKS5 
							proxy in their web browser or tunnel their connection through the Tor network.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 id="initial-setup"><span>8.3</span> Initial setup</h3>
					<ul class="formulas">
						<li>
							A random 512 bit <i>API Key</i> is created using the TRNG included with the program and entered 
							into the configuration file on the server. The user can use SSH to access their VPS, but ideally to 
							get the key securely onto the server, the server could be hosted on their local network running a web 
							server with a static public IP that is serving to the wider Internet. Storing the key in 
							the configuration file prevents SQL injection attacks to retrieve the key and also it saves a 
							database lookup each request.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <i>API Key</i> is given to each user in person (not using a key exchange protocol or sent 
							via an insecure network). This will be done in the initial key exchange between users as the program 
							can store the <i>API Key</i> and server address along with the one-time pads.
						</li>
						<li>
							The protocol currently caters for 2 - 7 users per group. If additional chat groups are required 
							on the same server this can also be setup. The cap of seven users per group is an arbitrary 
							restriction and can easily be extended. With larger group sizes however, each user gets less 
							one-time pads allocated to them for sending messages. In future the protocol could allow certain 
							users who talk more often a greater allocation of one-time pads for sending, e.g. one user 
							broadcasting announcements to the other users.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 id="send-and-verify-api-request"><span>8.4</span> Client API request</h3>
					<ul class="formulas">
						<li>
							User creates a random 512 bit per request <a href="#ref106"><i>Nonce</i><sup>[106]</sup></a>. 
							The server keeps track of sent nonces to prevent replay attacks. The nonce is created using 
							the Web Crypto API <a href="#ref69">getRandomValues<sup>[69]</sup></a> method.
						</li>
						<li>
							User creates an API request including a group of data variables to send to the server as part of the 
							<i>Message Packet</i>. For example, this can contain the one-time pad encrypted message 
							and its MAC that the server will store.
						</li>
						<li>
							Each request is sent with an <i>API Action</i> to perform on the server. This prevents the attacker 
							from changing what action to perform on the server because any change to the data packet will alter 
							the MAC.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <i>From User</i> data indicates which user the message is from. The server uses this to retrieve 
							the correct key. All users on the server are coded to 
							<a href="#ref104">NATO phonetic alphabet<sup>[104]</sup></a> names i.e. 
							Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot and Golf. This allows some anonymity when multiple servers 
							around the world are using the same protocol. When exporting the one-time pads, the user can assign call 
							signs/nicknames to the chat users within the group to override the default names. These nicknames are 
							not transmitted to the server because they are kept in the user's local storage next to the one-time 
							pads.
						</li>
						<li>
							A <i>Sent Timestamp</i> is included to indicate when the request was sent. This is a 
							<a href="#ref105">UNIX timestamp<sup>[105]</sup></a> therefore both the client and 
							server code use UTC time.
						</li>						
						<li>
							The server rejects messages received that are received more than +/- 60 seconds of the 
							received UNIX timestamp. The server and clients should be synchronized to an NTP server. The 
							60 second allowance should be enough to counter any clock drift and subtle differences 
							between the server and client clocks.
						</li>
						<li>
							The server rejects duplicate messages/replay attacks received within the allowed time window 
							by storing all received nonces and checking incoming message timestamps against past received 
							nonces. If the nonce is the same and same request is received twice, then the second request 
							will be invalid. Sent nonces are kept on the server for at least 120 seconds and then 
							discarded by a separate cleanup process.
						</li>
						<li>
							These variables are stringified into JSON and a MAC is calculated using version 1.3 of the 
							<a href="#ref109">Skein<sup>[109]</sup></a> 512 bit (Skein-512) hash function on 
							the JSON data:<br>
							<br>
							<i>MAC</i> &#8592; <i>Skein-512</i>( <i>API Key</i> || <i>API Action</i> || <i>From User</i> || <i>Nonce</i> || <i>Sent Timestamp</i> || <i>Message Packet</i> )
						</li>
						<li>
							The client sends the JSON data and the MAC to the server. The server receives the request, looks up 
							the username and verifies it is a valid user for that chat group, then verifies the request by 
							recreating the same MAC with the data provided.
						</li>
						<li id="double-hmac-validation">
							The server rejects invalid MACs, which will also mean any attempt to modify the data sent 
							will fail. The MAC validation method in the API is protected against timing side channel 
							attacks using a method very similar to 
							<a href="#ref110">Double HMAC Verification<sup>[110]</sup></a>. This randomises the byte 
							order for each comparison so measuring timing differences for an attacker is practically 
							impossible. The differences in this program are that it uses the secure hash function 
							Skein-512 rather than HMAC-SHA-2 and some random data is introduced for each comparison as 
							an added security measure:<br>
							<br>
							<i>function constantCompare</i>( <i>Calculated MAC</i>, <i>Received MAC</i> )<br>
							{<br>
							<span class="functionInner"><i>Random Data</i> &#8592; Collect 512 bits from /dev/urandom</span><br>

                            <span class="functionInner"><i>return</i> ( <i>Hash A</i> === <i>Hash B</i> )</span><br>
							}
						</li>
						<li>
							Failed requests can be re-sent manually by the client which will use a different <i>Nonce</i>, 
							<i>Sent Timestamp</i> and <i>MAC</i>.
						</li>
						<li>
                            The program also <a href="#ref112">Base64<sup>[110]</sup></a> encodes the entire packet 
							before sending in preparation for version 2.0. In version 2.0 the packet will also be 
							encrypted between the client and server and then Base64 encoded. The data going back and 
							forth will essentially just be a random binary blob. This will help disguise meta data and 
							make it much harder for spy agencies to fingerprint the traffic as definitely originating 
							from this program and prevent them targeting the client machines or server with automated 
                            <a href="#ref103">TAO hacking tools<sup>[103]</sup></a> or malware 
							that has been mentioned in the Snowden revelations. The current version will just 
							provide an extra annoyance to the Five Eyes agencies who will need to update their 
                            <a href="#ref102">XKeyScore<sup>[102]</sup></a> detection rules and decode the Base64 data

					</ul>
					
					<h3 id="server-api-response"><span>8.5</span> Server API response</h3>
					<ul class="formulas">
						<li>
							On any valid server requests, the server signs the response with the <i>API Key</i> so that 
							the user knows the response from the real server. Invalid requests throw an 
							<code>HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found</code> error. This means an attacker does not even know if 
							there is a valid application or web page on the web server if they do not have the 
							<i>API Key</i> to make a valid request. All invalid requests respond with the server 
							pretending it is unable to find what the attacker is looking for. This is similar to 
							standard firewall behaviour by just failing to respond at all when an attacker is scanning 
							for open ports on a machine, rather than responding with a distinct 'closed' response 
							which indicates there is something there.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <i>Server Message Packet</i> contains data sent from the server including status responses 
							and the one-time pad encrypted messages.
						</li>
						<li>
							The original <i>Client Request MAC</i> is included in the server's response MAC calculation 
							so the client can be sure it is receiving a response to the original request.

					<h2 id="frustrating-traffic-analysis"><span>9</span> Preventing information leakage and traffic analysis</h2>
					<p>
						The program ends decoy messages at random intervals to other users in 
						the chat group to prevent 
						<a href="#ref113">information leakage<sup>[113]</sup></a> about when 
						real messages are sent and to frustrate 
						<a href="#ref65">traffic analysis<sup>[65]</sup></a>. The technique 
						used is similar in principle to the 
						<a href="#ref114">Chaffing and Winnowing<sup>[114]</sup></a> 
						cryptographic technique. On starting a 
						chat session, each client will generate a random number between 1000 and 90,000 using the 
                        <a href="#ref69">browser's CSPRNG<sup>[69]</sup></a>. 
                        A timer will be started and after this number of milliseconds have 
						elapsed the program will generate a random string of bytes up to 56 bits bits in length. Using 
						the accuracy of milliseconds rather than seconds gives more randomness for each timer interval. 
						Otherwise every decoy message would be sent on evenly rounded seconds and an attacker could 
						determine that they were decoy messages.
					</p>
					<p>						
						The program will then check if these 56 bits exist as a pad identifier in their own set of 
						one-time pads. If that pad identifier already exists, which is quite rare, then it will skip 
						sending a decoy message for this interval, generate a new random number and try again after 
						that many milliseconds have elapsed. If the pad identifier does not already 
						exist, then the program will send a decoy message to the other users in the chat group. The other 
						chat group users will safely ignore the decoy message as the pad identifier does not exist in 
						their copy of the one-time pad database for the user that is sending the message. To send a 
						decoy message the program simply generates a further random 1480 bits using the 
                        <a href="#ref69">browser's CSPRNG<sup>[69]</sup></a> 
						and concatenates that to the end of the 56 bit random pad identifier, thus forming a random 
						string consisting of 1536 bits which is the same size as a regular one-time pad and message packet. 
						This method also avoids burning real one-time pads on decoy messages which would be wasteful.
					</p>
					<p>
						The random message packet is sent to the server and left on there for the other chat group 
						users to collect. It effectively looks no different than a regular message being sent. The other 
						chat group users will download it, determine it is not a real message because the pad identifier 
						does not exist in the set of pads belonging to that user and discard it. The other users may not 
						be saying anything but each client that is connected to the server will be sending decoy messages 
						to other users in the group at random intervals. If two or more clients are left unnattended 
						it can look like an entire conversation is taking place without doing anything. This disguises 
						when real messages are actually sent by the users. An outside attacker that can monitor all 
						network traffic has no way of determining whether a message sent or received is a decoy or a real 
						one. 
					</p>
					<p>
						If a client is online but there have been no real or decoy messages received from other chat 
						clients for 5 minutes then the decoy timer will stop. This is so it doesn't appear like one user 
						is just	talking to themself. If another client comes online again and sends a real message or 
						decoy message then the first client will start up their timer again on a random interval to keep 
						sending decoy messages. This continues until a user quits the program or all other users are 
						offline for over 5 minutes. This is more than the maximum random timer interval 
						(90 seconds) so there is some overlap when users are coming online/offline. These intervals 
						may be customisable via the UI in future versions or further optimised for network bandwidth 
						usage.
					</p>
					<p>
						An added bonus of this functionality is that if a user has come online and received a new decoy 
						message from another user they can know that the other user is most likely online (+/- 90 seconds) 
						without any other kind of signalling protocol being needed. The program will also show that the 
						other user is online immediately if a real message is received within the last 5 minutes as well.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="using-tls"><span>10</span> Using Transport Layer Security (TLS) / HTTPS</h2>
					<p>
						Because of the new server authentication protocol in version 1.3, using TLS is not mandatory anymore. 
						However it can be added as an optional layer of security to help mitigate monitoring from 
						lower level attackers, for example when using the program in a workplace, public WiFi hotspot or 
						home connection where an employer, casual hacker or ISP could monitor the connection. 
						<a href="#ref45">TLS will not stop a nation state attacker<sup>[45]</sup></a> 
						like the NSA as it is possible they have obtained copies of the root keys for most 
						Certificate Authorities anyway by using 
						<a href="#ref94">National Security Letters<sup>[94]</sup></a>, therefore 
						they can perform an active <a href="#ref44">MITM<sup>[44]</sup></a> 
						attack as traffic is passing through the <a href="#ref5">Five Eyes<sup>[5]</sup></a>  
						alliance countries (USA, UK, Canada, Australia and NZ). It is also possible 
						<a href="#ref36">they have quantum computers<sup>[36]</sup></a> 
						by now. The public key exchange protocols used in TLS are vulnerable to quantum computers, as 
						are most of the common cipher suites which use symmetric keys of only 128 bits. Key lengths of 
						<a href="#ref116">256 bits are the minimum required<sup>[116]</sup></a> to 
						remain safe against quantum computers in the immediate future. Care must also be taken to use a 
						good cipher suite order to have forward secrecy and use the highest quality ciphers available.
					</p>
					<p>						
						Users still wanting to use TLS and don't mind the extra effort to configure it are recommended to 
						generate a strong (4096+ bit RSA) self-signed certificate themselves using 
						<a href="#ref117">the guide on the site<sup>[117]</sup></a>, install it on the server and deliver 
						the fingerprints of the certificate to the chat group users at the same time as the one-time pad 
						key exchange which they can manually verify when first connecting to the server.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="trng-custom"><span>11</span> User Chosen TRNG</h2>
					<p>
						The software allows a user to import truly random data directly from their own trusted entropy 
						source. This could be a <a href="#ref22">hardware RNG<sup>[22]</sup></a>, physical entropy source 
						or even capturing the output from Linux/Unix's <a href="#ref70">/dev/random<sup>[70]</sup></a>. 
						This gives the user some flexibility and can allow for creating a lot more one-time pads than 
						can be created using the TRNG included with the program.
						
						Because the user can freely choose to use their own entropy source for creating the one-time pads, 
						this rules out any possibility that the author of the program is interested in restricting the user 
						to use a poor quality random number generator which would expose the user to covert surveillance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Users can change the file type of the file they are importing from pure binary, to a plain text 
						file containing <a href="#ref186">hexadecimal<sup>[186]</sup></a> symbols or Base64 characters. 
						Once uploaded, randomness tests found in <a href="#ref124">FIPS 140-2<sup>[124]</sup></a> will 
						be run on the random data to ensure that the imported random data is up to a minimum acceptable 
						level.
						If the tests pass, the user can export the random data and the 
						program will split up the random data into separate one-time pads for use with the program. Users 
						do not have to rely on the FIPS 140-2 tests alone, they can of course run any number of external 
						randomness tests on their data to ensure it is of good quality before importing it.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="trng"><span>12</span> Included TRNG</h2>
					<p>
						The new design of the True Random Number Generator (TRNG) included in version 1.5.2 onwards 
						improves on the previous versions with new inspiration from two very good papers: 
						<a href="#ref215">The Sources of Randomness in Mobile Devices<sup>[215]</sup></a> and 
						<a href="#ref216">Towards True Random Number Generation in Mobile Environments<sup>[216]</sup></a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						This section describes the TRNG included with the program which gathers 
						the entropy contained in the <a href="#ref71">shot noise<sup>[71]</sup></a> noise 
						from a digital camera. The collected entropy is run through a 
						<a href="#ref252">randomness extraction<sup>[252]</sup></a> process to ensure a uniformly 
						distributed random data.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the papers mentioned above, their testing was done against the optical sensor noise by 
						capturing frames from the view finder with the lense cap still on. Independent testing of their 
						results shows that this does give some entropy in the resulting data. Through more 
						extensive testing described further on it is shown that even better entropy can be 
						obtained by taking high resolution photographs of the natural environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						To prevent interference or bias by software noise reduction and compression, a digital camera's 
						<a href="#ref74">RAW mode<sup>[74]</sup></a> should be used. The RAW image file should then be
						converted as-shot (without post-processing) to a lossless format like 
						<a href="#ref75">PNG<sup>[75]</sup></a> or <a href="#ref76">BMP<sup>[76]</sup></a> for the TRNG 
						program to process. This can be done with Photoshop or using free software such as 
						<a href="#ref224">Shotwell photo manager<sup>[224]</sup></a>. This process best retains and 
						preserves the optical sensor noise.
					</p>
					<p>
						Saving in a lossy algorithm like <a href="#ref77">JPEG<sup>[77]</sup></a> may have unintended 
						side effects from performing optimisations on the photograph. Users can however verify the 
						random data from each step in the process, export the data and check if it passes various 
						statistical tests such as <a href="#ref124">FIPS 140-2 Power-Up Tests<sup>[124]</sup></a>, 
						<a href="#ref248">NIST SP 800-22<sup>[248]</sup></a>, <a href="#ref249">ENT<sup>[249]</sup></a> 
						and <a href="#ref250">Diehard<sup>[250]</sup></a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Not all users will have a camera capable of taking photographs in RAW format, so the program 
						also includes a tool to capture camera frames directly from a webcam using the native 
						<a href="#ref253">HTML5 getUserMedia()<sup>[253]</sup></a> API. The user can then save 
						the captured photographs as lossless PNG files which can be loaded separately into the TRNG. 
						If their webcam does not produce large enough photographs and random 
						data for a substantial number of one-time pads, then there is another tool provided to help 
						with this. The user can then load multiple sets of random data produced by the TRNG and 
						concatenate it together and convert it into a single binary file. That binary file of random 
						data can then be loaded into the program and it will create the one-time pads from it.
					</p>
										
					<h3 id="quality-photo-selection"><span>12.1</span> Selecting quality photographs</h3>
					<p>
						Nature is random, unpredictable and always changing. For example, the sand on the seashore 
						changes every time the tide rolls in. Wave crests and currents change with the weather and tides. 
						Deciduous trees change depending on the season of the year. Trees and leaves move in the wind. 
						The sun strikes things in different angles and intensity throughout the day, casting shadows in 
						various directions. The variance of cloud cover and light conditions alters the appearance of 
						everything in different ways.
					</p>
					<p>
						From a photographer's position they have a unique viewpoint of a scene in nature. They can take 
						a photo of <i>anything</i> in nature, giving an infinite number of possible photographs. They 
						can take photographs of things that are random in nature such as a 
						<a href="#ref73">macro<sup>[73]</sup></a> (extreme close-up) shot of sand on a beach, grass, 
						rocks or flowers. Or a regular photos of bushes, trees blowing in the wind, wave crests in the 
						ocean, or waves crashing against the sea shore.
					</p>
					<p>
						Photographs should be taken of things in nature e.g. sand, rocks, flowers, bushes and trees. 
						For smaller items like sand, macro mode should be used. For best results, all photographs should 
						be in focus as much as possible and taken with good exposure. Care should be taken to avoid 
						direct sunlight or overexposure in certain areas of the photograph. Photographs should always 
						be erased after one-time pads have been created from them and not left on any storage device.
					</p>
					

					<h3 id="photo-processing-algorithm"><span>12.2</span> TRNG design</h3>
					<p>
						This full design is explained below:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The user selects two high resolution photographs of good quality. Ideally their photos should 
							be taken in <a href="#ref74">RAW mode<sup>[74]</sup></a> from a standalone digital camera 
							(if available), then converted as-shot (without post-processing) to a lossless format such 
							as PNG. There are a number of open source tools available for the conversion.
						</li>
						<li>
							The program then loads the photographs into memory as sequential arrays of pixels. The top 
							left pixel would be the first element in the array, followed by the rest of the pixels in 
							that row (left to right), followed by the pixels in the rows below and so on. Each pixel in 
							the photograph contains 24 bits of colour information, encoded as separate Red, Green, Blue 
							and Alpha (RGBA) integer values. The alpha channel data is not used and is discarded. For 
							each remaining colour channel (RGB) they have 8 bits of information, represented as a number 
							from 0 to 255. If each pixel contained its own array of values, all the data in the 
							photograph would be represented in a format similar to:<br>
							<b>[ [ 120, 234, 123 ], [ 57, 23, 254 ], [ 14, 255, 0 ], ... ]</b>.<br>
							<br>
							For easier processing, this is converted to a sequential array format similar to:<br>
							[ <b>120, 234, 123, 57, 23, 254, 14, 255, 0, ... </b>].<br>
						</li>
						<li>
							<ol class="roman">
								<li>
									For the first image, the first 3 colour channel values representing a single RGB 
									pixel are collected e.g. <b>[ 120, 234, 123 ]</b>. These values are then converted to 
									binary format:<br>
									<b>[ 01111000, 11101010, 01111011 ]</b>.
								</li>
								<li>
									In <a href="#ref215">the paper<sup>[215]</sup></a> mentioned earlier, the minimum 
									entropy estimate was approximately 1-3 bits per colour channel. This program takes 
									a conservative approach using the lower estimate of 1 bit of entropy per colour 
									channel. The program then collects the 
									<a href="#ref72">least significant bit<sup>[72]</sup></a> (rightmost bit) of each 
									colour value:<br>
									<b>[ 0, 0, 1 ]</b>.
								</li>
								<li>
									These 3 bits are then XORed together e.g. <b>0 &oplus; 0 &oplus; 1</b> which results in the 
									single bit <b>1</b>. This bit is then stored by appending it to an output stream of 
									bits obtained from this image.
								</li>
								<li>
									The previous 3 steps (i - iii) are then repeated for the remaining pixels in the 
									first photo. This produces a full output stream of bits from the pixels in the first 
									image.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							Step 3 is then repeated for the second image which produces a full output stream of bits 
							from the pixels in the second image.
						</li>
						<li>
							The two output streams from the first and second images are then XORed together to create a 
							combined output stream. In testing, occasionally one photo might have small sections where 
							the output was not uniformly random. The bits from the second image help provide protection 
							against faults in the first image and vice versa. This can happen when there is a small 
							section that is overexposed to sunlight e.g. a reflection or a small gap through the leaves 
							of a tree. If the two photos were of different sizes then the output from this step will 
							be truncated to the same number of bits from the smallest photo.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <a href="#ref217">Basic Von Neumann Extractor<sup>[217]</sup></a> is then run on the 
							combined output stream in step 5 which is the final random data. This simple theoretic 
							extractor is used to ensure a uniformly distributed output in the combined output stream. 
							This is better than using a cryptographic hash function for extraction e.g. SHA-3 as these 
							are not known to be perfect or information-theoretically secure.
						</li>
						<li>
							The data from steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 are then run through randomness tests. Black and white and 
							also colour bitmaps of the output can be displayed to the user for visual analysis. If any 
							failures occur the user can delete the images and try again with a fresh set. The testing 
							process is described in the next section.
						</li>
						<li>
							After successful processing and test analysis, the user should erase the original 
							photographs from the camera's memory card and the computer's hard disk. If full disk 
							encryption is used, only a regular deletion is needed.
						</li>
						<li>
							The final random data is then split it into separate one-time pads of 1536 bits each.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						It is important to note that this algorithm does not use this collected entropy to seed a   
						<a href="#ref122">PRNG, DRBG<sup>[122]</sup></a> or <a href="#ref123">CSPRNG<sup>[123]</sup></a> 
						to give an unlimited amount of random data. The aim is to avoid stretching the available 
						entropy over more bits. The program aims to be a <i>true</i> random number generator so only 
						high quality randomness is used. Each uniformly random bit must be used to encrypt only one bit 
						of the plaintext otherwise the security proof of the one-time pad is lost.
					</p>
										
					
					<h3 id="output-testing"><span>12.3</span> TRNG testing tools</h3>
					<p>
						An important part of a random number generator is the ability to test the output. A few methods 
						have been provided for this:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The program allows the user to extract the random data from each step in the processing to 
							various formats i.e. binary file, ASCII binary text file, ASCII hexadecimal text file and 
							ASCII Base64 text file. Because the TRNG only outputs data from two images at a time, there 
							is also another tool to combine the random data from multiple text files and output a single 
							binary file. This gives users the opportunity to verify the data with external randomness 
							testing programs e.g. <a href="#ref248">NIST SP 800-22<sup>[248]</sup></a>, 
							<a href="#ref249">ENT<sup>[249]</sup></a> and <a href="#ref250">Diehard<sup>[250]</sup></a>. 
							That will allow them to run additional tests and assure them of the quality of the random 
							data.
						</li>
						<li>
							For testing the random data within the program there are some simple statistical random number 
							generator tests included from <a href="#ref124">FIPS 140-2 - Power-Up Tests<sup>[124]</sup></a>. 
							These include: The Monobit Test, The Poker Test, The Runs Test and The Long Run Test. The 
							goal is to add more automated tests in the future to prove the quality of the program and 
							improve on it in future versions of the software. The FIPS 140-2 test suite is run on every 
							20,000 bits of the random data at each step of the process.
						</li>
						<li>
							If any of the tests fail after this, then one or both of the original source photographs 
							may not be good enough and different ones might need to be used. Although the pass intervals 
							for these tests is quite strict and <a href="#ref219">can sometimes give false positives<sup>[219]</sup></a>, 
							it is still a good indicator to rule out very bad source photographs. The following 
							example shows an example of the test result summary:
							<br>
							<a href="img/trng-processed-images.png">
								<img class="listImage" src="img/trng-processed-images.png" alt="TRNG test results">
							</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							Looking at these results, the second image which was based on a JPEG image failed the tests 
							on the unconditioned least significant bits. This may not be a problem though as a closer 
							look at the tests might reveal it just failed one of the tests on a 20,000 bit segment by 
							being slightly outside of the accepted intervals. If a lot of the tests across multiple 
							20,000 bit segments were failing then this would be a very clear warning that the photograph 
							is not of good quality and another should be used.
						</li>
						<li>
							The aim of the TRNG is that if one photo does not produce very good random test results, then 
							there is a second photo as a failsafe. Looking at the results after XORing the least 
							significant bits from the two images together, the tests are shown as passing. The final Von 
							Neumann extraction step ensures that the data is uniformly random. The users should check 
							that the final two steps which XOR the least significant bits of both images together and 
							the Von Neumann extraction step succeed or the photos should be discarded. It does not 
							matter so much if the unconditioned least significant bits from either image fail slightly. 
							These minor failures can be recovered from with the final two steps. If the user finds two 
							images that pass all the tests at every step, then this is the best possible outcome.
						</li>
						<li>
							The output from each step of the TRNG can also be viewed as a black and white 
							<a href="#ref125">bitmap<sup>[125]</sup></a> image or colour bitmap image which lets a user 
							do a simple visual analysis of the output. 
							<a href="#ref126">People are very good at spotting patterns<sup>[126]</sup></a> and 
							visualising the random data allows them to use their eyes and brain for this purpose. If 
							there is any structure in the image this indicates a poor image source. It also gives a basic 
							visual picture of the TRNG's output.<br>
							<br>
							To produce a black and white bitmap image, all the random data is converted to binary and 
							rendered as a bitmap. A black pixel with RGB values of [0, 0, 0] indicates a <b>1</b> bit 
							and a white pixel with RGB values [255, 255, 255] indicates a <b>0</b> bit. The height and 
							width of the image is determined by the square root of the number of bits that can be output. 
							This produces a square image and each pixel is rendered sequentially to fill the image row 
							by row. The output should look something like the image below at 100% zoom.<br>
							<br>
							<div class="bitmapExamples">
								<div class="bitmap">
									Good image<br>
									22,500 pixels (22,500 bits)<br>
									<img src="img/random-bitmap-good-example.png" alt="Random bitmap good example">

									Bad image<br>
									22,500 pixels (22,500 bits)<br>
									<img src="img/random-bitmap-bad-example.png" alt="Random bitmap bad example">
								</div>
							</div>
							<br>
							To produce a colour bitmap image, all the random data is converted to binary. For each 8 
							bits, this is converted to a decimal value from 0 - 255. Then for every 3 decimal values 
							this represents the RGB values of a single pixel. The height and width of the image is 
							determined by the square root of the number of full pixels that can be output. This produces 
							a square image and each pixel is rendered sequentially to fill the image row by row. The 
							output should look something like the image below at 100% zoom.<br>
							<br>

						For testing, a 12 MP <a href="#ref127">Canon PowerShot G9<sup>[127]</sup></a>

						For testing the unconditioned least significant bits the full number of bits was divided into 8 
						bitstreams. Of these bits only a few of the bitstreams had failures. For most, 8/8 bitstreams 
						passed, however there were a few that had 7/8 bitstreams pass and a couple with 5/8 or 6/8 
						bitstreams that passed. For the results in the XORed least significant bits, this was tested as

						Taking photographs of static things also worked well and the unconditioned least

					<h4 id="dark-frame-options">Dark frame options</h4>
					<p>
						Results that did not work very well were dark frames where photographs were taken with the 
						lense covered to simulate a lense cap being on. The data was not strong enough to pass most of 
						the FIPS 140-2 tests. In testing there was some noise on the least significant bits and the 
						pixels were not completely black (0, 0, 0), but the resulting data was far from uniformly random. 
						An example is shown below:
					</p>
					<div class="testImages">
						<div class="image">
							Dark frame<br>
							<img src="img/randomness-tests/dark-frame-preview.png">
						</div>
					</div><br>
					<p>
						In testing it required the least significant bits from four dark frame photographs to be XORed 
						together to be strong enough to pass the FIPS 140-2 tests. Comparing this to the regular 
						photographs tested above, they only required the least significant bits of a single photograph 
						to pass the tests so they should be preferred compared to dark frame photographs.
					</p>
					<p>
						These results differ from the results in the 
						two papers<a href="#ref215"><sup>[215]</sup></a><a href="#ref216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> mentioned 
						earlier which suggested using a dark frame to capture the thermal noise in the camera. This can 
						likely be attributed to the different methodology. It can be shown that letting in a small 
						amount of light into the frame and taking a photograph of a static cream painted wall was good 
						enough to let more noise onto the camera sensor and produce a strong result for a single frame 
						that passed the FIPS 140-2 tests. An example is shown below:
					</p>
					<div class="testImages">

					<p>
						Testing was also done by taking photographs with a Logitech C920, which is a high end webcam 
						capable of recording video in high definition (1080P). A regular laptop webcam with 2MP was also 
						tested. In both cases, the test results were similar to the Canon G9 and the least significant 
						bits of all images passed the FIPS 140-2 tests.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>
						In summary, the best results are achieved using the macro mode on a digital camera and taking close-up 
						shots of things like sand. Shooting a variety of things like rocks, trees or water can also give 
						good results. Users can experiment taking photos of various things in nature on their own. Users 
						should take care to verify the unconditioned random data passes the tests from FIPS 140-2. This 
						will give reasonable confidence for using it as one-time pads.. 
					</p>
					<p>
						With this TRNG and a single 12 MP photo, it is possible to produce enough random data for 
						approximately 1980 messages. For a group of two people this would be 990 messages per person 
						which is enough to last for a reasonable period of time. If more messages are required then 
						users can can generate multiple sets of one-time pads and load additional sets as necessary when 
						they run out. It is also possible to concatenate the random data from multiple sets together 
						using a tool included in the program. The only limit will be the amount of local storage that 
						can be used in the browser.
					</p>		
															
					<h2 id="pad-storage-export"><span>13</span> Pad storage and exporting data</h2>
					<p>
						After the one-time pads have been created, they must be exported separately for each user. Part of this 
						process automatically determines who will be sending with what one-time pads. The one-time pads are divided 
						up equally amongst the group members and allocated to each user for sending. This prevents one user from 
						accidentally sending with another user's allocated one-time pads, causing a two-time pad situation and 
						allowing for cryptanalysis. All users get read access to the other group member's one-time pads, so when 
						a message is received from another user they can decrypt it.
					</p>
					<p class="diagram">
						<img alt="Export settings" src="img/export-pads-settings.png">
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							This screen contains all the details that will be saved to each export file for each chat group user. 
							The person creating the chat group should input the server address and API key here so that when other 
							users import the file they do not need to do any additional configuration. All they need to do 
							then is load the one-time pads into their browser and start chatting. 
						</li>
						<li>
							A server API key can be generated from this screen. The program effectively takes 512 bits from the 
							start of the extracted random data and uses it as the key. This 512 bits is now no longer available 
							for use as a one-time pad. This API key is manually loaded up into the server's config file by the user. 
							After this the user can test the connection to the server to make sure everything is set up correctly.
						</li>
						<li>
							The user can also define how many users will be in the chat group. They can customise the user's name 
							or nickname next to the call sign. The custom nickname is kept locally and stored with the one-time pads. 
							This way each chat group user has the same set of names and knows who is in the conversation. The custom 
							nickname is not sent over the network, only the call sign (alpha, bravo etc) is sent as part of each 
							network request so the server can send/receive messages for that user. This means only the real users 
							know who is talking to who. If there are multiple people and chat groups around the world using the 
							same protocol and different servers, then it makes traffic analysis even more difficult.
						</li>
						<li>
							There are 2 export options for using the one-time pads with the program. <b>Export to clipboard</b> 
							lets the user copy/paste the pads from memory into wherever they want to put them. 
							<b>Export to text file</b> pops up a save dialog to save the pads to a text file on their 
							filesystem or portable storage media.
						</li>
						<li>
							Saving to removable media such as a CD, DVD, MicroSD, SD card or USB drive will be convenient and 
							portable. Flash memory is at least small and compact which means the user can conceal, destroy or 
							get rid of it quickly and easily. The most secure option may be to use CDs/DVDs which can be 
							written once, transferred to each user, then destroyed. The most convenient option is to get 
							a USB thumbdrive, with a portable version of <a href="#ref79">Firefox<sup>[79]</sup></a> 
							loaded on it. Then save the one-time pads in there as well. Load up Firefox and then load 
							the one-time pads from inside it. Now the program is portable and the user can take it with 
							them on a keyring, run it from any trusted computer (e.g. home or work) and stay in contact 
							wherever they are.
						</li>
						<li>
							Hard drives and flash memory <a href="#ref131">are difficult<sup>[131]</sup></a> to remove 
							data from quickly and securely. It is best if sensitive data like encryption keys do not get 
							written to the disk in the first place. The program allows for the one-time pad database to be 
							encrypted and authenticated before transport. This is detailed in full in the next section.
						</li>
						<li class="formulas">
							The password/passphrase used should have at least 256 bits of entropy for transport which is 
							estimated to be 41 ASCII characters. In version 2.0 the database will be encrypted all the 
							time so users may opt for a shorter password for faster access on their mobile devices.
							The password strength estimator calculates a rough estimate of the password strength in bits 
							as the user is typing. Password characters are assumed to be drawn uniformly randomly among the 
							most commonly used characters on a standard US keyboard. This is calculated as uppercase A-Z 
							(26 characters) plus lowercase a-z (26 characters) plus numbers 0-9 (10 characters) for a 
							total of 62 characters. This will produce a more conservative entropy estimate than if special 
							characters were included as well (i.e. the full 95 ASCII printable characters). The formula 
							will also take into account the 
							<a href="#ref28">Password Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF)<sup>[28]</sup></a> iterations 
							which roughly increases the security in bits by <i>log<sub>2</sub></i>( <i>Iterations</i> ) 
							e.g. <i>log<sub>2</sub></i>( <i>10,000</i> ) which is approximately 13~ bits. The full 
							formula for calculating the entropy of the password in bits is as follows:<br>
							<br>
							<b>Entropy Bits</b> &#8592; ( <i>Number of Password Characters</i> &otimes; <i>log<sub>2</sub></i>( <i>62</i> )) + <i>log<sub>2</sub></i>( <i>Number of PBKDF Iterations</i> ).

					<h2 id="database-encryption"><span>14</span> One-time pad database encryption and authentication</h2>
					<p>
						The program can encrypt and authenticate the one-time pad database prior to export and 
						transportation to other chat group users. The program uses a cascade of two strong stream ciphers 
						for encryption and a cascade of two modern MAC algorithms for authentication. This provides 
						additional assurances such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The database has not been tampered with in transit. An attacker cannot replace the 
							one-time pads with ones that they already know which would allow covert surveillance, set 
							all the one-time pads to zero bits which would nullify the encryption, subtly duplicate the 
							one-time pads in the database which would allow for two-time pad cryptanalysis, or swap pads 
							between users which would cause indecipherable messages for other users in the group.
						</li>
						<li>
							The database is not easily readable if stolen or seized in transit. A computationally unbounded 
							adversary could in theory break the cascade encryption after many decades of brute force 
							attack with a quantum computer, but this is very unlikely. If a user knew that their 
							one-time pad database was stolen or seized (e.g. at an international airport) then they 
							would notify the other chat group users to stop using that set of one-time pads immediately 
							and switch to a different set. Then only the small number of messages which had been sent 
							since one-time pad generation until that point in time would be compromised. Because only a 
							small number of messages would have been sent during this time and the database is very 
							difficult to crack, then this reduces the likelihood an attacker would even try mounting a 
							brute force attack.
						</li>
						<li>
							After successful transportation of the one-time pads without interception or tampering, the 
							database can be quickly deleted and the rewritable transport media (e.g. MicroSD card, SD 
							card, USB drive) can be re-purposed for something else which would overwrite the database 
							eventually anyway. Because an attacker does not even have the encrypted one-time pad 
							database, it is not absolutely necessary to secure erase the media or destroy it (e.g. 
							write once CD, DVD media) unless absolute security is required.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						In version 2.0 of the program, which is currently in development, the same encryption will be 
						used to secure the database as it resides on the client devices. Pads will be decrypted as they 
						are needed, used to encrypt a message, then deleted from the database. The program does not currently  
						provide any steganography for transporting the database, so if this is needed in the near future 
                        it is advised to use a 
						<a href="#ref132">TrueCrypt 7.1a hidden volume<sup>[132]</sup></a><a href="#ref133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> 
                        and store the one-time pad database inside it. If an attacker forces the user to reveal the password 
						they can reveal the outer volume password which would reveal decoy files, and they would still 
						have plausible deniability that a hidden volume containing the one-time pads does not exist.
					</p>
					
					<h3 id="cascade-database-encryption"><span>14.1</span> Cascade database encryption</h3>
					<p>
						To encrypt each one-time pad in the database a cascade of two strong, reputable stream 
                        ciphers is used. The ciphers are the 
                        <a href="#ref134">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)<sup>[134]</sup></a> 
                        in <a href="#ref135">Counter Mode<sup>[135]</sup></a> (AES-CTR) 
                        and <a href="#ref136">Salsa20<sup>[136]</sup></a> with the full 20 rounds. AES, 
                        which is based on the Rijndael algorithm by Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen, won the 
                        <a href="#ref137">Advanced Encryption Standard competition<sup>[137]</sup></a>. 
                        A reduced 12 round variant of Salsa20 (Salsa20/12) by Daniel J. Bernstein was selected for the 
                        <a href="#ref138">eSTREAM software portfolio<sup>[138]</sup></a>. 
                        The full 20 round variant of Salsa20 was chosen for additional security. 
						Two random 256 bit keys are generated using the TRNG at export time. One key is used for AES-CTR 
						and the other for Salsa20. A different nonce is used for each one-time pad to be encrypted in the 
						database. The design Exclusive ORs (XORs) the AES-CTR keystream and the Salsa20 keystream 
						together then XORs the combined keystream with the plaintext one-time pad.
					</p>
					<p>
						The reason a cascade of two stream ciphers is used is because there may be secret cryptanalytic 
						techniques against a cipher such as AES when it's used to encrypt something on its own. A 
                        recent publication of the Snowden documents revealed that 
                        <a href="#ref18">NSA have their own in-house (non public) cryptanalytic techniques
                        against AES and other ciphers<sup>[18]</sup></a>. 
						While a trivial reversal of a strong cipher without any additional information is highly 
						unlikely and would be indicative of the algorithm being very weak, it may be more likely that a single 
                        encryption algorithm <a href="#ref140">becomes vulnerable<sup>[140]</sup></a> to NSA when they 
						have access to <a href="#ref139">known plaintext<sup>[139]</sup></a> or 
						<a href="#ref141">chosen plaintext<sup>[141]</sup></a> encrypted by the algorithm as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a stream cipher cascade, the separate keystreams are XORed together. There is no way to 
						determine which bits belong to each cipher's keystream if each cipher is suitably strong on 
						their own. Even if there is a cryptanalytic break in AES, 
						an attacker does not have access to the raw keystream created by the AES algorithm because 
						there is still plaintext and the Salsa20 keystream mixed in with it. Even if an attacker knows 
						a lot of the plaintext they still won't be able to decrypt the AES layer of encryption because 
						the layer underneath is a random Salsa20 keystream which they do not know. Likewise if they 
						tried to decrypt the Salsa20 encryption layer first, the next layer is a random AES keystream 
						so they would not even know when they have decrypted the first layer correctly. The best 
						remaining attack against a stream cipher cascade may be a brute force of both keys which would 
						take a very long time.

							The reason to encrypt each row individually rather than encrypting the entire database at 
							once is for performance. Also in the upcoming version 2.0 of the program the database will 
							always be encrypted on disk, so it is advantageous to only have the small keys in memory and 
							decrypt each row as needed then delete the row.
						</li>
						<li>
							The keys remain the same for the entire database but the nonce changes for each database row 
							to be encrypted. The keys for encryption and authentication are obtained from slicing the 
							required number of bits off the beginning of the TRNG generated random data. This ensures 
							the keys are not used for anything else and the one-time pads are generated from the 
							remaining random data.
						</li>
						<li>
							Because AES in Counter Mode does not need a random IV, a unique nonce is used for 
							encrypting each row. Each one-time pad has an index number in the database starting from 0 
							up to the number of pads in the database. One user might have index numbers from 0 - 1000 in 
							their set of one-time pads and the next user might have index numbers from 1001 to 2000 in 
							their set. This ensures there is a unique index number for each row in the database. This 
							number is converted to hexadecimal and left padded with 0 bytes (<code>00</code> in hexadecimal) 
							up to 96 bits in length. The block counter for AES is 32 bits in length starting at 0 
							(<code>00000000</code> in hexadecimal) for each row and increments by 1 for each subsequent 
							block being encrypted.
						</li>
						<li>
							The nonce for Salsa20 is 8 bytes, so the pad index number is is converted to hexadecimal 
							and left padded with 0 bytes (<code>00</code> in hexadecimal) up to 64 bits in length. The 
							block counter for Salsa20 is also 8 bytes starting at 0 (<code>0000000000000000</code> in 
							hexadecimal) for each row and increments by 1 for each subsequent block being encrypted.
						</li>
						<li>
							The first 56 bits of a one-time pad is the pad identifier which is public and used to 
							lookup the correct pad in the database when another user sends a message. The pad 
							identifier is not encrypted and removed prior to encryption so only the remaining 1480 bits 
							of the random pad are encrypted. This removes any remaining known plaintext for an attacker 
							if they attempt to decrypt one of the one-time pads.
						</li>
						<li>
							There is some pad database information which is stored in the client database as well 
							(program version, custom user preferences, server address, server key, user callsign and 
							list of group user nicknames). This is JSON encoded to a string and encrypted with the same 
							database keys, but the static 96 bit nonce <code>ffffffffffffffffffffffff</code> in hexadecimal 
							for AES-CTR and the static 64 bit nonce <code>ffffffffffffffff</code> for Salsa20 is used for 
							encryption. Because each pad index number is converted to a nonce and in the language being 
							used integers cannot exceed 2<sup>53 - 1</sup> (9,007,199,254,740,991), this nonce cannot be 
							accidentally be re-used for encrypting a pad, therefore it is used it to encrypt the pad 
							database information.

							The resulting MAC tag is stored along with the other information for each row. When the

							for each database row and verify that the hash digest matches the stored MAC tag for the row. 
							If there is a match for each row then no tampering has occurred, otherwise a warning will be 
							shown to the user. If the warning is shown, then the user should abandon the database of 
							one-time pads and look to transfer a new set.
						</li>
						<li>
							In this version of the program, the database is verified only when loading the pads initially 
							after they have been exported and transported. Currently after the pads are verified and 
							decrypted, the database is saved to the client PC in an unencrypted state. Running the

							release to keep the one-time pads encrypted locally on the disk. In the future, version 2.0 
							of the program will have the one-time pad database be fully encrypted and authenticated at 
							all times. Each one-time pad row will need to be verified and decrypted before sending or 
							receiving a message. The reason for why this functionality is not available in this version 
							is that the application needs to be converted to a Single Page Application first. Currently 
							each web page is run separately and there is no in memory data sharing between pages. 
							Converting to a single page application will reduce code duplication and mean the master 
							password only needs to be entered once on startup, not once for each page opened.

					<ul>
						<li>
                            The first PBKDF is <a href="#ref146">PBKDF2<sup>[146]</sup></a> with the 
                            Keccak-512 hash function. The output key size is set at 512 bits. A 1536 bit random salt 
							which was generated by the TRNG is used. The default number of iterations is set at 10,000 
							which takes about 8 seconds to compute on a single core of an Intel Core i5 running at 3.3 
							GHz.
						</li>
						<li>
                            Note that <a href="#ref147">Keccak can be used in conjunction with HMAC<sup>[147]</sup></a> 
                            which is what PBKDF2 uses internally. The reason to use Keccak instead of 
                            <a href="#ref148">SHA-2<sup>[148]</sup></a> or SHA-1 is because it is a 
                            newer hash function and it is not designed by the NSA. Anything designed by the NSA is avoided 
                            by this program in case it has deliberate secret weaknesses that are unknown to the academic 
                            community. An algorithm designer is in the best position to design an algorithm 
							with a subtle weakness. In the case of SHA-2 a weakness may not be discovered for many years 
							if academia is well behind the state of the art in cryptography. For SHA-1 it barely lasted 
							a few years before needing to be phased out due to significant flaws.
							
							We know at one point <a href="#ref149">the NSA were 20 years ahead in cryptography<sup>[149]</sup></a> 
                            when they knew about differential cryptanalysis before anyone else. They are likely still 
                            ahead by a large margin. Using Keccak which was the winner in an open competition and which 
                            has a design which is completely open is considered much safer. In comparison to SHA-2, Keccak 
                            should provide better entropy in the derived key, however it may be a lot faster in hardware 
                            which would provide a slightly better advantage for an attacker performing a brute force attack.
							
                            However the main attacker to be considered is the NSA and we can reasonably assume they have dedicated 
                            <a href="#ref150">ASICs<sup>[150]</sup></a> and other hardware for cracking password hashes 
							which were derived using the most commonly used PBKDFs simply because everyone in the world is 
							using those algorithms. By using the newer Keccak algorithm this essentially forces the NSA 
							to expend more money building new dedicated ASICs or re-engineer their supercomputer code 
							just to crack an encrypted database created by this program. Even then they would still need 
							physical access to the encrypted database so they might not even bother trying.
						</li>
						<li>
							The second PBKDF uses the Skein hash function. The output key size is set at 512 bits. The 
							same 1536 bit random salt which was generated by the TRNG is used. The default number of 
							iterations is set at 10,000 which takes about 5 seconds to compute on a single core of an 
							Intel Core i5 running at 3.3 GHz.							
						</li>
						<li>
                            The Skein PBKDF method is described in 
							<a href="#ref155">Section 4.8 of The Skein Hash Function Family</a> specification 
							document. Quoting the document:<br>
							<i>"The application stores a random seed S, asks the user for a password P, and then 
							performs a long computation to combine S and P." ... "An even simpler PBKDF is to simply create 
							a very long repetition of S and P; e.g., S || P || S || P || S ..., and hash that using Skein. 
							(Any other optional data can also be included in the repetition.) This approach is not ideal 
							with a normal hash function, as the computation could fall into a loop. But in Skein, every 
							block has a different tweak and is thus processed differently."</i>
						</li>
						<li>
							There are important reasons for this cascade construction, in particular the aim is to 
							protect against failures in at least one of the algorithms for true long term security:<br>
							<ul>
								<li>
									An adversary cannot parallelize the workload by computing both derived keys at the 
									same time because <i>Derived Key B</i> depends on the result of <i>Derived Key A</i>.
								</li>
								<li>
									The entropy in the <i>Master Key</i> is not lowered if PBKDF-Keccak is weak because 
									the <i>Password</i> and <i>Salt</i> are also included in PBKDF-Skein.
								</li>
								<li>
									The entropy in the <i>Master Key</i> is not lowered if PBKDF-Skein is weak because 
									it is XORed with <i>Derived Key A</i>.
								</li>
								<li>
									The <i>Master Key</i> is at least as strong as the strongest function and retains 
									the entropy in the <i>Password</i> and <i>Salt</i> even if one of the functions is 
									weak or compromised.
								</li>
								<li>
									It is hard to perform cryptanalysis on the output of each function individually 
									because the output is XORed by random data from the other function.
								</li>
								<li>
									The user can choose not store the number of Keccak or Skein iterations with the rest of 
									the database. The user would remember the iterations or write them down separately on a 
									piece of paper. This may be useful if passing through international airport security and 
									there is a high likelihood of the data being confiscated and copied. This forces an attacker 
									with only the database to try every iteration count for every password permutation. To 
									counter an attacker simply caching the results of previous iteration counts and running the 
									PBKDF on one password at a time, the number of iterations are appended to the end of the 
									<i>Salt</i> at runtime. This forces the attacker to do the full PBKDF iterations for every 
									reasonable iteration count the user could have chosen e.g. 1 - 10,000+ then repeat that for 
									all possible password permutations.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>												
						<li>
							For added security an option exists in the user interface to use custom iteration counts. 
							The user can decrease the number of iterations for slower portable devices and use a longer 
							password to compensate. The user may also choose to increase the iteration counts to make 
							the database more resilient to attack. The default of 10,000 iterations for each of the 
							PBKDFs is a good balance between strength and slow speed of the JavaScript runtime engine.
						</li>						
						<li>
							The total length of the <i>Salt</i> is the same length of all the database keys (256 bits 
							AES-CTR encryption key + 256 bits Salsa20 encryption key + 512 bits Keccak MAC key + 512 
							bits Skein MAC key) which adds up to 1536 bits. Normally passwords do not contain much 
							entropy, so the <i>Salt</i> which was randomly generated by the TRNG is used as a backup to 
							add additional entropy to safely secure the database keys.
						</li>
						<li>
							Another option exists in the user interface to store the 1536 bit <i>Salt</i> as a separate 
							keyfile. The advantage of this is to store the keyfile on a separate storage device (e.g. 
							MicroSD card) or written down on a piece of paper which can be easily hidden if the database 
							is at risk of being compromised in transit. If an attacker can confiscate or steal the 
							primary device (e.g. notebook PC) which has the encrypted database but cannot find the 
							keyfile as well then it is practically impossible to crack the database encryption in any 
							reasonable timeframe. Future versions may allow this keyfile to be hidden inside an image 
							file using steganography.

						Four sub keys are derived from the master key and are used to encrypt the actual database

					<ul>
						<li>
							A simple KDF2 construct to get encryption and authentication keys from a master key would 
							apply the hash function twice. Once with the <i>Master Key</i> and a unique <i>Counter</i> 
							(e.g. <code>01</code>) to make an encryption key, and again with the <i>Master Key</i> and another unique 
							<i>Counter</i> (e.g. <code>02</code>) to gain a unique MAC key. If the keys used for encryption is compromised 
							it is computationally hard to find a pre-image for the one-way hash function to determine 
							the <i>Master Key</i> or the derived MAC key. Similarly if the MAC key is compromised it is 
							hard to reverse the process to find the <i>Master Key</i> or encryption key. This cascade construct 
							performs two hashes for each derived key, once using Keccak on the <i>Master Key</i> and 
							unique <i>Counter</i>, then again with the Skein algorithm and another unique <i>Counter</i>. 
							Finally it XORs the resulting random hash digests together to produce the derived key. This 
							adds additional assurances that the derived key will not be easily reversed if there is a 
							flaw in either algorithm discovered in the future.
						</li>
						<li>
							The resulting derived keys are 512 bits in length. The first and second derived keys are

						The following describes the encryption and authentication of the actual database keys using the 
						derived keys from earlier:
					</p>
					<div class="formulas">
						<b>Database Keys</b> &#8592; The actual AES-CTR, Salsa20, Keccak and Skein database keys, concatenated together<br>
						<b>Nonce<sub>1</sub></b> &#8592; A static 96 bit nonce for AES-CTR (<code>000000000000000000000000</code> in hexadecimal)<br>
						<b>Nonce<sub>2</sub></b> &#8592; A static 64 bit nonce for Salsa20 (<code>0000000000000000</code> in hexadecimal)<br>
						<b>Counter<sub>1</sub></b> &#8592; A 32 bit counter for AES-CTR, starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 for each block being encrypted<br>
						<b>Counter<sub>2</sub></b> &#8592; A 64 bit counter for Salsa20, starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 for each block being encrypted<br>
						<br>
						<b>Keystream<sub>1</sub></b> &#8592; <i>AES-CTR</i>( <i>Derived Key<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>Nonce<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>Counter<sub>1</sub></i> )<br>
						<b>Keystream<sub>2</sub></b> &#8592; <i>Salsa20</i>( <i>Derived Key<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>Nonce<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>Counter<sub>2</sub></i> )<br>

						<b>Cascade MAC</b> &#8592; <i>MAC<sub>1</sub></i> &oplus; <i>MAC<sub>2</sub></i><br>
					</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							After encryption and authentication, the encrypted database keys and the Cascade MAC are stored 
							in the database. To decrypt the database, a user will enter their password, load the keyfile and 
							set the number of iterations. It will perform the same steps above to generate the derived Keccak 
							and Skein keys, recreate the MAC against the stored encrypted database keys, then match that 
							against the stored MAC. Any incorrect match may mean an incorrect password, keyfile or number 
							of iterations used. Alternatively, if the password, keyfile or number of iterations is correct 
							it could indicate a more serious matter such as database corruption or that someone has 
							tampered with the database.

					<h2 id="using-html5"><span>16</span> Using HTML5</h2>
					<p>
						Thomas Ptacek's article, <a href="#ref158">Javascript Cryptography Considered Harmful<sup>[158]</sup></a> 
						raises a valid point about JavaScript code being delivered by the web server being insecure 
						against MITM attacks. The article in general however is now outhated and blanket statements 
						saying that all JavaScript cryptography is harmful is misleading and inaccurate. In reality, 
						there are <a href="#ref159">sensible<sup>[159]</sup></a> and 
						<a href="#ref160">secure<sup>[160]</sup></a> solutions to the problems raised and all of 
						his other concerns <a href="#ref161">have been reasoned and mitigated<sup>[161]</sup></a> as 
						well.
					</p>
					<p>
						In summary, most points they made are not applicable for this program due to the fact that the 
						source code is downloaded as a signed <a href="#ref162">.tar.gz<sup>[162]</sup></a> 
						archive file and users are expected to verify the file's <a href="#ref245">GnuPG<sup>[245]</sup></a> 
						signature with the one from this website to ensure its authenticity. From there the code should 
						be run <i>locally</i> from the machine by going to the directory and running index.html which 
						will load the website and code into the browser. This means all 
						code is always running locally from the local hard drive and the web address will be similar to 
						<code>file:///media/truecrypt1/jericho/client/index.html</code>. All the executable code is self 
						contained and does not rely on any server delivered JavaScript at all. It essentially becomes a 
						regular client side application except it runs inside a browser to make use of the browser's 
						rendering and JavaScript runtime engines. This itself mitigates the majority of the problems 
						the Matasano Security article raised.
					</p>
					<p>
						HTML5 has more advantages than disadvantages. It's easier and faster to develop with. New APIs 
						allow for <a href="#ref115">cryptography<sup>[115]</sup></a>, 
						<a href="#ref163">persistent database storage<sup>[163]</sup></a>, 
						<a href="#ref164">messaging<sup>[164]</sup></a> and 
						<a href="#ref165">file management<sup>[165]</sup></a>. Browsers are first in line for security 
						updates and the best ones are open source and trustworthy. People rely on browsers to have good security 
						to do their Internet banking and shopping online. The source code does not need to be compiled. 
						Users or security researchers can verify the source code being run live in the browser using 
						Chromium or Firefox built-in Web Development tools or with browser add-ons like 
						<a href="#ref166">Firebug<sup>[166]</sup></a>. This allows them to verify the code is doing 
						exactly what it should be. HTML5 is cross platform, one code base can literally run on Windows, 
						Linux, Mac, phones and tablets simply with the latest web browser. Newer projects such as 
						<a href="#ref246">Electron<sup>[246]</sup></a> or <a href="#ref247">PhoneGap<sup>[247]</sup></a> 
						allow the packaging of HTML5 code into a native app for various platforms. One of 
						the goals of the project is to get a truly secure chat program functioning on an open hardware 
						platform and an open operating system like <a href="#ref167">Firefox OS<sup>[167]</sup></a>. 
						This is a true open source OS for smartphones and tablets from a reputable organisation that 
						believes that <a href="#ref168">individuals' security and privacy on the Internet is 
						fundamental<sup>[168]</sup></a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently this program has been tested to work in the latest versions of the open source browsers 
						<a href="#ref169">Firefox<sup>[169]</sup></a> and <a href="#ref170">Chromium<sup>[170]</sup></a>. 
						Some of the other popular browsers have not implemented the Web Crypto API 
						yet. The layout is responsive and will work on desktops and tablets. Some more work and testing 
						is still required to get it working nicely on mobile. In particular a method to 
						load the one-time pads into the program using later versions of Android. Using Firefox is 
						recommended as they are open source and are not involved in the 
						<a href="#ref171">PRISM surveillance program<sup>[171]</sup></a>. Unfortunately nobody can say 
						for sure about that with Google so the proprietary Google Chrome browser is not recommended. 
						Firefox is still preferred in comparison to Chromium as 
						<a href="#ref172">Google were recently caught out<sup>[172]</sup></a> trying to backdoor it 
						with a closed source binary which captured audio from the microphone. There's nothing stopping 
						them from trying similar acts of subversion in future unless users are watching closely for 
						these issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is recommended to <a href="#ref173">create a new browser profile<sup>[173]</sup></a> inside a 
						<a href="#ref53">TrueCrypt<sup>[53]</sup></a> volume to protect the one-time pads when 
						they are stored inside the browser storage. In a future version of the program it will keep the 
						one-time pad database encrypted locally at all times.
					</p>
					<p>					
						The main crypto library this program uses is <a href="#ref174">CryptoJS<sup>[174]</sup></a>. 
						There were some other libraries that would be good to use but they either did not work in a 
						<a href="#ref175">HTML5 Web Worker<sup>[175]</sup></a> which makes 
						CPU intensive cryptographic functions take significantly longer and 
						<a href="#ref176">blocks<sup>[176]</sup></a> the user interface thread, or their outputs couldn't be verified 
						from the reference test vectors. It is important to verify that the code can produce the same 
						hash outputs as the test vectors from the specification documents. This ensures the program is 
						not using a faulty or backdoored version of the algorithm that gives incorrect results.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="json-rest-api"><span>17</span> REST API using JSON</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The client browsers communicate to and from the server using JSON and the 
							REST API on the server. The server side code is currently written for the latest version of 
							PHP 5.x using best security practices for protection against 
							<a href="#ref179">SQL injection<sup>[179]</sup></a> and other attacks. This will likely be 
							rewritten in a different language in the next release e.g. 
							<a href="#ref178">NodeJS<sup>[179]</sup></a> to have a common cryptographic library base 
							across the client and server. This will allow for a simple integration of the data 
							encryption between the clients and server in order to hide the 
							<a href="#ref180">metadata<sup>[180]</sup></a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							The server sends <a href="#ref177">CORS<sup>[177]</sup></a> HTTP headers so that the client 
							browsers can connect and make a cross-origin request. This is 
							needed because the program is run locally from the <code>file:///</code> location and not 
							served by a webserver. If the JavaScript code was served from a web server it could let an 
							attacker perform a MITM attack and alter the code, this could then make the user send 
							unencrypted messages and they would not be any wiser.
						</li>
						<li>
							For now the browsers use an <a href="#ref181">AJAX<sup>[181]</sup></a> 
							request to send/receive data to/from the server. The reason for this is that the chat can be delayed 
							like email (encrypted messages remain on the server until they are received), or real-time if users 
							are connected at the same time. If a user is connected it will check for new messages from the server 
							every 3 seconds which is fast enough to appear as real-time and does not stress the server too much.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						A summary of the request/response protocols are shown below:
					</p>
					
					<h3 id="api-send-message"><span>17.1</span> Send message</h3>
					<p>
						This is the request the client makes when sending a message.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img class="listImage" src="img/api-send-message-json.png">
					</p>
					
					<h3 id="api-send-message-response"><span>17.2</span> Send message server response</h3>
					<p>
						This is the response the server makes after it has received a request to send a message.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img class="listImage" src="img/api-send-message-server-response-json.png">
					</p>
					
					<h3 id="api-receive-messages"><span>17.3</span> Receive messages request</h3>
					<p>
						This is the request each client makes every 3 seconds. This will get any new messages from the server 
						for the user making the request.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img class="listImage" src="img/api-receive-messages-json.png">
					</p>
					
					<h3 id="api-receive-messages-response"><span>17.4</span> Receive messages response</h3>
					<p>
						This is the response the server will make after receiving a request from a client for retrieving new messages.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img class="listImage" src="img/api-receive-messages-response-json.png">
					</p>
					
					<h3 id="api-auto-nuke"><span>17.5</span> Initiate self destruct request</h3>
					<p>
						This is the request a client makes if they want to wipe the all the other chat group user's 
						local one-time pad databases. It is very disruptive and designed for use only in an emergency. 
						This command is sent encrypted and authenticated via the secure message channel. This is so 
						only a valid user with the set of one-time pads can trigger an auto nuke. An attacker with 
						access to the server cannot change anything to trigger the chat group users to delete 
						their local databases in order to disrupt communications.
					</p>
					<p>
						To trigger the request, the user will visit a separate screen in the user interface and click 
						a button. The client will automatically send a regular message with the string code 
						<code>init auto nuke</code>. This will be encrypted with one of the one-time pads, authenticated 
						with the MAC and sent to the server like a regular message. The initiating user's current local 
						database of one-time pads will then be wiped and their screen cleared.
					</p>
					
					<h3 id="api-auto-nuke-response"><span>17.6</span> Self destruct initiated response</h3>
					<p>
						If a chat group user is checking for new messages and an authentic message comes through with the 
						code <code>init auto nuke</code>, instead of continuing to receive and process new messages, the 
						user's client will show a notification that the self destruct has been initiated by the user who 
						initiated it, then the program will immediately wipe their local database of any data and clear 
						the screen of any sent or received messages.
					</p>
					<p>
						After all users have had their local databases wiped, the server database of one-time pads can 
						be cleared by the server administrator. There is no real risk in leaving the encrypted messages 
						on the server for a longer period of time as every one-time pad encrypted message has 
						information-theoretic security and plausible deniability. 
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="message-encoding"><span>18</span> Message encoding</h2>
					<p>
						Each one-time pad is made up of 192 bytes which is 384 hexadecimal symbols or 1536 binary digits. See the 
						table below for more information:
					</p>
					<p class="diagram">
						<img src="img/pad-encoding.png">
					</p>
					<p>
						Each message is made up of three main parts, the pad identifier, the message parts and the message authentication code. The 
						one-time pad is used to encrypt the message parts and the MAC tag.
					</p>
					<p class="diagram">
						<img src="img/message-encoding.png">
					</p>			
					<p>
						This can be further broken down to the individual message parts. See below for the length of each part:
					</p>
					<p class="diagram">
						<img src="img/message-encoding-full.png">
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							At the moment the program only supports messages typed using the 
							<a href="#ref182">ASCII printable character set<sup>[182]</sup></a>. 
							This is all the characters that can be seen on a standard US keyboard. In practicality 
							this limits the languages that can be used to English and ones that use the 
							<a href="#ref183">basic Latin alphabet<sup>[183]</sup></a> e.g. Dutch, German, French, 
							Indonesian, Portuguese and Spanish but without the 
							<a href="#ref184">diacritical marks<sup>[184]</sup></a>. This is for ease of development at 
							the moment and the program will support other languages with proper 
							<a href="#ref185">UTF-8<sup>[185]</sup></a> encoding and decoding in the future.
						</li>
						<li>
							All messages that are sent/received are encoded to hexadecimal format first which is just stored 
							in a normal JavaScript string. This is to make transport using JSON easier rather than trying to 
							send UTF-8 encoded data over the wire. A hexadecimal symbol 
							(<a href="#ref188">Nibble<sup>[188]</sup></a>) is 4 bits, and two hexadecimal symbols 
							makes 8 bits (one <a href="#ref189">Octet/Byte<sup>[189]</sup></a>) 
							and can be represented as a single ASCII character.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <b>Pad identifier</b> is the first 7 bytes (56 bits) from the one-time pad. This identifies to 
							the receiver which pad should be used to decrypt the message. This is used rather than sending the 
							sequence number of the one-time pad to remain in sync with the other users as that could reveal to 
							an attacker the number of messages sent so far.
						</li>
						<li>
							The maximum message length has been set at 115 bytes (115 ASCII characters) for now. This is slightly 
							less than the size of a <a href="#ref190">tweet<sup>[190]</sup></a> 
							(140 characters) or an <a href="#ref191">SMS<sup>[191]</sup></a> (160 characters). This is 
							because generating enough random data takes a long time. Making a message length longer than that, 
							where the one-time pad may or may not be fully used is wasteful. If users need more than 115 
							characters they can simply send a second message. In future a new feature will be added to allow 
							a message to be spread over multiple one-time pads.<br>
							<br>
							If a message is less than 115 bytes in length it is padded to the right (up to the maximum 115 bytes) 
							with random bits generated from the Web Crypto API. This hides the actual length of the message to 
							frustrate any cryptanalysis. For example if no padding was added and the message was simply "hi" then 
							the ciphertext would be the same length which could aid the attacker. Of course there are a few other 
							words with only two letters which allows for some uncertainty. However if the message is padded up to the 
							full 115 bytes each time, then an attacker knows nothing about the true length of the message, 
							only that it is somewhere between 1 and 115 bytes long.<br>
							<img class="listImage" src="img/message-padding.png" alt="Message padding">							
						</li>						
						<li>
							The <b>Actual message length</b> is the true message length without any padding. It is an aid in the decryption 
							process so it can remove the correct number of padding bytes from the end of the message and reveal the original 
							plaintext automatically. This field is always 1 byte in length which is enough to represent the message length. 
							For example, if the message was 70 bytes long, then the number 70 is converted to binary and left padded (if necessary) 
							to be 8 bits long. 8 bits can have 2<sup>8</sup> (256) possible values which represents the numbers from 0 to 255. 
							One byte of information can store the actual message length of 1 to 115 bytes easily. The actual message length is 
							also encrypted with one byte from the one-time pad so it is impossible for an attacker to know the actual message 
							length without the one-time pad. An attacker only knows that the length of a message is between 1 and 
							115 bytes. When decrypting the message, the message length value is checked to make sure it is in the 
							correct range. This helps avoid <a href="#ref207">denial of service<sup>[207]</sup></a> (DOS) 
							and/or buffer overflow attacks.
						</li>
						<li>
							A UNIX timestamp is sent along with the message in the <b>Message sent timestamp</b> field 
							to signify when the message was sent from the sender's computer. This is converted to binary 
							and sent with the message packet. 5 bytes are reserved for this. It could 
							easily be 4 bytes (32 bits), but an extra byte was added to avoid the 
							<a href="#ref192">year 2038 problem<sup>[192]</sup></a>. 
							This timestamp is also encrypted with 5 bytes of the one-time pad. This prevents an attacker from 
							interfering with the date or time of the message which could be critical in some circumstances. It is 
							also used for correctly reordering messages on the client side when retrieving multiple messages from 
							the server. This prevents an attacker reordering messages from them gaining access to the server or by 
							delaying server responses.
						</li>
						<li>
							The final part of the encoding is the <b>MAC tag</b>. This MAC tag is sent along with each message for 
							authentication and integrity to ensure that the message has not been tampered with. The MAC tag is 
							also encrypted with part of the one-time pad so it is also information-theoretically secure. The 
							process is explained in depth further on.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					
					<h2 id="encryption-process"><span>19</span> Message encryption process</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The program first receives the plaintext message from the user from the text box when they click the 
							<i>Send message</i> button. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Then it does a lookup on the user's local database of one-time pads and selects the first available 
							one-time pad allocated to that user for sending messages. The one-time pads for sending/encrypting 
							messages are evenly pre-allocated and grouped under each user in the chat group e.g. alpha, bravo, 
							charlie etc. This prevents one user from encrypting a messsage using the same one-time pad as another 
							user.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once a one-time pad has been selected, it removes it from the local database and splits it into the pad 
							identifier, the message parts and the MAC parts. The encryption process is as follows:
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="diagram">
						<img src="img/encryption-process.png" alt="Encryption process">
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							In step one, the plaintext with padding, the message length and the timestamp are converted to binary 
							and concatenated together.
						</li>
						<li>
							In step two, because some of the bits of the 40 bit UNIX timestamp can be predictable, this could leave 
							a <a href="#ref140">crib<sup>[140]</sup></a> for an attacker and they 
							could recover those few bits of the key. This however would not compromise the remainder of the plaintext 
							because each bit of the one-time pad is random and independent from the rest. For example, if the 
							timestamp was 1406440512 for 
							2014-07-27 at 5:55am in UTC then that would convert to binary as <code>00000000 01010011 11010100 10010100 01000000</code>. 
							If we compare another time in the future, 1503040500 for 2017-08-18 at 7:15am in UTC then that would 
							convert to binary as <code>00000000 01011001 10010110 10010011 11110100</code>. The first 12 bits are 
							the same in both timestamps even though the dates are years apart. This is because the timestamp field 
							is larger than currently required in order to future proof the protocol. If it was the usual 32 bits then 
							eventually there would be incorrect dates and times shown in the program after 
							<a href="#ref192">19 Jan 2038<sup>[192]</sup></a>.<br>
							<br>
							To remove this as a possibility for being a crib, the program randomly reverses the binary message parts 
							(including the plaintext with padding, the message length and the timestamp) depending on the second 
							last byte in the one-time pad. It does this by converting this byte to an integer value (0 - 255), 
							then uses that number modulo 2. This will return a random integer of 0 or 1. A one will mean the 
							message parts get reversed while a zero will mean they stay the same. This means that every message, 
							an attacker does not know for certain whether the timestamp is at the front or end of the message 
							parts. They also do not know whether the true plaintext begins at the start of the message or the end. 
							Because all users have the same one-time pad, they can reverse this transformation to get the message 
							parts back in proper order after decryption. This transformation has a similar purpose to 
							<a href="#ref193">Russian copulation<sup>[193]</sup></a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							In the third step, the <a href="#ref48">XOR<sup>[48]</sup></a> operation is what does the 
							encryption. Each bit of the plaintext is encrypted with a unique bit of the one-time pad. 
							With a truly random one-time pad the 
							<a href="#ref194">encryption is unbreakable even in theory<sup>[194]</sup></a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							The final step concatenates the pad identifier to the ciphertext message parts. The pad identifier helps 
							the other users determine which one-time pad was used to encrypt the message.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once the message has been encrypted, the MAC is created using a random MAC algorithm that was 
                            selected and then encrypted with part of the one-time pad. This process is explained further on. 
							The MAC is concatenated to the end of the ciphertext and sent with the message to the server. 
                            The server holds the message until all the other users have retrieved it.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					
					<h2 id="decryption-process"><span>20</span> Message decryption process</h2>
					<p>
						The user first checks for encrypted messages on the server that are not sent by them and have not been 
						read already by them. This will retrieve all other messages sent by users in the same chat group. 
						Once the encrypted messages have been retrieved by the user, the messages are marked as read on the server 
						by them. Once all users have read the message, they are deleted from the server in a cleanup process which 
						runs every 30 seconds. The process for decryption is generally the same as encryption but in reverse order. 
						For each encrypted message that is received:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The program selects the sender of the message e.g. alpha, bravo, charlie etc and does a lookup on the 
							local database of one-time pads for that user. The program selects the pad identifier (first 7 bytes) 
							from the ciphertext which will match the first 7 bytes from one of the one-time pads in the database. 
							The pad identifier for each one-time pad is stored in a separate field which makes searching faster. 
							It then retrieves the one-time pad for the message and takes off the pad identifier.
						</li>
						<li>
							The MAC is then decrypted with the last 64 bytes of the one-time pad. Using the ciphertext message 
							parts, the one-time pad and the random algorithm for the MAC, the MAC is calculated. If this matches 
							the MAC sent, then the message is valid and has not been tampered with. Decryption of the message 
							will follow. If the message matches the MAC sent with the message then an 'Authentic' status is 
							displayed to the user. If the message is not valid, the user is warned that tampering has occurred 
							and the decryption process will not be attempted.
						</li>
						<li>
							The one-time pad message parts is then XORed with the ciphertext message parts (including the 
							plaintext with padding, message length and timestamp). This returns the decrypted text with padding, 
							the actual message length and the time the message was actually sent.
						</li>
						<li>
							Depending on the second last byte of the key, the decrypted message parts are returned to their original 
							order (unreversed) if that transformation was made in the encryption process.
						</li>
						<li>
							The message length part is read and this gets the length of the actual message in bytes. Reading 
							from the start of the plaintext message up to the message length will retrieve the actual plaintext 
							without padding.
						</li>
						<li>
							The one-time pads for any messages received and verified authentic are then deleted from the user's 
							local database.
						</li>
					</ul>
	
					
					<h2 id="message-authentication"><span>21</span> Message Authentication Code</h2>
					<p>
						The one-time pad is vulnerable to a <a href="#ref195">bit-flipping attack<sup>[195]</sup></a> if 
						not authenticated with a MAC. Therefore the program calculates and sends a secure MAC with each 
						message. Both users have a shared secret, which is the one-time pad for each message so the MAC 
						can be calculated and verified by either person. This simple MAC construction is a temporary 
						solution which should be fine until there is time to write a more standardised one-time MAC 
						implementation based on the <a href="#ref187">Carter-Wegman MAC<sup>[187]</sup></a>.<br>

						<li>
							For each message sent, a random MAC algorithm from a pool of algorithms is chosen to authenticate the 
							message. This provides some protection in the case that a fundamental flaw is discovered in one of the 
							hash algorithms in the future. It also makes message forgery more difficult as an attacker now only 
							has a 0.5 probability to guess the correct hash algorithm that was used to authenticate each message. 
							Currently there are only 2 hash algorithms that are used with the program due to the lack of current 
							library support. Currently the hash functions used are the 512 bit versions of 
							Keccak and Skein. These 512 bit MACs will provide 2<sup>256</sup> collision resistance and 
							2<sup>512</sup> pre-image resistance against regular computers. They  
							<a href="#ref196">will provide 2<sup>170</sup> collision resistance<sup>[196]</sup></a> and 2<sup>256</sup> 
							pre-image resistance against quantum computers.
						</li>
						<li>
							The program first gets a random index number from an array of available algorithms, then 
							it uses this algorithm to create the MAC. It selects the random array index by using the last byte of 
							the one-time pad. It converts this byte to an integer value (0 - 255), then uses that number modulo 
							the number of MAC algorithms available. Because there are only two MAC algorithms at the moment, that 
							will return an integer of 0 or 1 which references the index of the algorithm in an array. For all 
							possible bytes from 0 - 255 this provides an even distribution of 0 - 1 outputs.
						</li>
						<li>
							The process is to perform the encryption on the message parts first, then calculate the MAC from the 
							ciphertext and use the one-time pad as the key. This provides integrity of the ciphertext and integrity 
							of the plaintext. Also it does not provide any information on the plaintext since no structure from 
							the plaintext has been carried into the MAC. Skein and Keccak are newer, more secure hash algorithms 
							and do not need more complicated constructions like HMAC to prevent length extension attacks unlike 
							hash functions based on the the <a href="#ref198">Merkle–Damgård construction<sup>[198]</sup></a>. 
							The MAC can be created simply by 
							<a href="#ref199">prepending the message with the key and hashing it<sup>[199]</sup></a><a href="#ref200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>, 
							i.e. <span class="formulas"><i>H</i>( <i>K</i> || <i>M</i> )</span>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Finally the MAC tag is encrypted with the last 64 bytes (512 bits) of the one-time pad. This 
							retains the <a href="#ref25">information-theoretically secure<sup>[25]</sup></a> 
							properties for the MAC tag as well as the message. No attacker can know if they have successfully 
							deciphered the encryption by brute forcing combinations of the key to create a valid MAC tag. Nor can 
							an attacker know if they have created a successful forgery when they do not know the correct key.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					
					<h2 id="failsafe-csprng"><span>22</span> Failsafe CSPRNG</h2>
					<p>
						For some functions of the program, general random bits or random numbers are needed. For these 
						functions it is not critical to have true randomness so a strong 
						<a href="#ref123">CSPRNG<sup>[123]</sup></a> will suffice:
					</p>
					<ul>						
						<li>Padding messages with random bits up to the maximum message length.</li>
						<li>Generating random numbers in order to send decoy messages at random intervals.</li>
						<li>Generating random 512 bit nonces for each server request.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Most browsers now support the HTML5 Web Crypto API 
						<a href="#ref69">getRandomValues() function<sup>[69]</sup></a> which uses 
						the operating system's cryptographically secure random source (e.g. <code>/dev/urandom</code> on 
						Linux). The Web Crypto API could however be compromised by running a closed source operating 
						system (e.g. Windows or MacOS) &ndash; in which case Microsoft or Apple could have been 
						<a href="#ref68">paid off by the NSA<sup>[68]</sup></a> to make it use the 
						<a href="#ref13">Dual EC DRBG<sup>[13]</sup></a> by default as far as anyone in the public knows.
						
						Or it could also be compromised by a faulty browser implementation. Or it could also be 
						compromised by the underlying operating system's implementation such as it uses 
						<a href="#ref67">Intel's questionable on-chip RNG<sup>[67]</sup></a> (RDRAND).
						
						No-one really has time to continually review the various browser implementations of the Web 
						Crypto API or the various operating system implementations of their RNGs to make sure they are 
						secure. So if the browser's implementation of this CSPRNG is compromised then a failsafe RNG has 
						been devised.
					</p>
					<p>
						The program will use a 256 bit key, to create a keystream of random bits using the failsafe 
						CSPRNG Salsa20. This keystream is then XORed with the random bits returned from the Web Crypto 
						API.
						
						A unique 256 bit key is generated for each user by the TRNG and exported with the user's 
						one-time pads upon pad creation. When they load the one-time pads, this key is also loaded into 
						memory.
						
						The program will start the nonce at <code>0</code>, and increment by <code>1</code> after every 
						request for random bits. The nonce value is persisted in the local database storage so a nonce 
						is never re-used even if the program is restarted. The nonce can be safely incremented to 
						<code>2<sup>53</sup> - 1</code> (the <a href="#ref201">maximum safe integer<sup>[201]</sup></a> 
						in JavaScript) without failure, but this is very unlikely to ever be reached under normal use.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="auto-nuke-process"><span>23</span> Self destruct process</h2>
					<p>
						The protocol normally erases the one-time pad as soon as a message is sent. The one-time pad is 
						also removed from a receiver's database after they have successfully received and authenticated 
						a message. This is a more secure form of off the record chat similar to the 
						<a href="#ref202">OTR messaging protocol<sup>[202]</sup></a>. 
						OTR has good principles but lacks the <a href="#ref25">perfect secrecy<sup>[25]</sup></a>  
						and <a href="#ref34">plausible deniability<sup>[34]</sup></a> of the one-time pad.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the key features of the program is being able to trigger a 
						<a href="#ref204">duress code<sup>[204]</sup></a> which instantly and automatically wipe the local 
						database of one-time pads, the other users' local databases of one-time pads and clear any messages 
						remaining on screen.
					</p>
					<p>
						This should be initiated in an emergency situation only. Potentially if a chat group user believes their 
						database of one-time pads may be compromised soon, or 
						<a href="#ref203">Three Letter Agencies<sup>[203]</sup></a> are inbound on a 
						<a href="#ref80">helicopter assault<sup>[80]</sup></a> then they 
						should initiate the self destruct. This means that all the users are no longer in possession of 
						the decryption keys so it means they cannot be compelled to produce them under duress or in a 
						court of law. No encryption keys means no way to decrypt past messages. Without the real encryption 
						keys, a user under duress can easily think of any plausible plaintext message for any encrypted message and 
						an aggressor will not know the difference. A simple way to calculate this for a one-time pad, given any 
						ciphertext is to simply create a fake message, convert the ciphertext and fake message to binary, 
						then XOR them together which will produce a plausible key to give to an attacker.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="extra-security-considerations"><span>24</span> Extra security considerations</h2>
					<p>
						There are a number of potential attacks which are more around 
						<a href="#ref205">social engineering<sup>[205]</sup></a>, side channel attacks, 
						retrieving the one-time pads by other means and attacks on the server. There are ways to 
						mitigate these issues as well.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Keyloggers, trojans or spyware on the PC could compromise the one-time pads or chat messages. 
							To mitigate this, the one-time pads should be generated on a clean install of an 
							open source Operating System and a clean browser install. 
							Running different virtual machines for different programs like 
							<a href="#ref50">Qubes OS<sup>[50]</sup></a> 
							to isolate any potentially malicious programs could be effective. A clean browser install 
							means removing all the inbuilt proprietary extensions like Java and Flash. When creating the 
							one-time pads, the PC should be physically unplugged from any network and any 
							wireless/bluetooth adaptors should be disabled. The pads should be saved to removable media 
							such as MicroSD card, SD card or USB drive. The Operating System should be secure wiped from 
							the hard drive after completion. Booting into a 
							<a href="#ref206">Linux Live CD<sup>[206]</sup></a> would be useful for this. For running 
							the chat program, ideally the OS should be open source e.g. Linux and the browser 
							software compiled from source code. Firewalls, antivirus and antispyware tools must be 
							installed and activated. Shared computers in a library or cafe should not be used.
						</li>
						<li>
							An attacker could steal/copy the one-time pads as they are being delivered to the other person. 
							The encrypted one-time pad database should be kept on a small MicroSD card, SD card or USB 
							drive with the person at all times. Securing it in a zipped up pocket can help prevent 
							pickpockets.
							If plausible deniability is needed, the one-time pads should be stored inside an encrypted 
							hidden volume with Truecrypt or other software. If the one-time pads have been misplaced they 
							have not been in the user's possession for a certain amount of time, they must be assumed to be 
							compromised and fresh ones must be created. Once loaded into each device, the encrypted text 
							file containing the one-time pads from the removable media should be erased. This leaves only 
							one copy of the pads which is being used by the software. The software will automatically 
							remove one-time pads as a message is received or sent.
						</li>
						<li>
							The server could be attacked or communications interfered with. Encrypted messages stay on 
							the server for a short period of time until the other chat participants retrieve them from 
							the server which is similar to email. However the requests to the server are frequent enough 
							that if both users are connected at the same time then it behaves as real-time chat. There 
							is potential for a nation state attacker to block communications and interfere with the 
							transmission of encrypted messages. They will not be able to decrypt any of the messages, 
							nor will they be able to forge or alter a message without detection due to the strong MAC. 
							However they could block messages being received, or hack into the server and delete messages 
							from the server, or perform a DOS type attack on communications.
							
							If an attacker like the NSA has already targeted the server 
							there is not much that can be done about it. The best option may be to set up a new server 
							somewhere else that they do not know about and inform chat participants of the new server 
							address. In the meantime the standard precautions for server installs should be used e.g. 
							setting up a firewall, blocking all ports except for port 80 which will be used by the 
							clients to connect to the server and port 22 for <a href="#ref208">SSH<sup>[208]</sup></a> 
							so the administer can still log in to the server. Changing the SSH port to a non-standard 
							port and using public key authentication could also be a consideration.
						</li>
						<li>
							Users will not be completely anonymous when communicating with the server. Potentially a 
							government may intercept the highly encrypted communications going from their IP address to 
							the server, and also from the server to the other user's IP. They may be suspicious at being 
							unable to decrypt the messages and try tracing the IP back to its source so they can arrest 
							the user for suspected terrorism. If everyone was using the program it would be considered 
							normal communications so they would be less likely to target a particular individual. Users 
							that are concerned about this could use a VPN or 
							<a href="#ref209">SOCKS proxy<sup>[209]</sup></a> with their browser to tunnel 
							their connections through a server in a different country. For added protection they could 
							always have chat conversations in a public place, e.g. cafe, library, WiFi hotspot or buy a 
							cheap pre-pay smartphone which will allow them to tether the Internet connection to their 
							laptop. 
							If using a mobile phone, it would be important to go somewhere different each time and then 
							connect to the cellular network. Also the GPS on the phone should be disabled so it is 
							harder to triangulate their position. For complete security the main battery should be 
							physically removed when done and a Faraday bag used to block any remote activation attempts  
							<a href="#ref210">even while it is turned off<sup>[210]</sup></a>. 
							The program does not currently work with the <a href="#ref211">Tor Browser Bundle<sup>[211]</sup></a> 
							because they block access to the local disk, so that rules out HTML5 Local Storage use. However 
							it is possible to configure the Tor application manually and use that as a SOCKS5 proxy with 
							a newer version of Firefox. It may even be possible to configure 
							<a href="#ref212">Tails OS<sup>[212]</sup></a> to load a Firefox 
							profile from a writable USB drive which could store and update the one-time pad database.
						</li>
						<li>
							Users could be forced to hand over their one-time pads with 
							<a href="#ref213">rubber-hose cryptanalysis<sup>[213]</sup></a> or 
							<a href="#ref214">beaten with a wrench<sup>[214]</sup></a>. While quite unlikely it could be 
							possible in some countries.
							The software makes sure that after a message is sent, the one-time pad is deleted from the 
							device so it can never be re-used. Then when the other user retrieves the message from the 
							server, the encrypted message is deleted from the server. In a group scenario, all users of 
							the group must have read the message before it gets deleted from the server. When a message 
							has been decrypted on the other user's device, it is deleted from their local database as 
							well. This leaves no way to decrypt past messages. It also gives the user plausible 
							deniability that they can decrypt past messages again or remember exactly what was said. To 
							clear messages from the screen one simply needs to refresh the page using the F5 key on their 
							keyboard. To clear everything in an emergency, the self destruct should be initiated. This 
							option is available from the main menu. It will delete the one-time pads from all devices 
							connected to the server. If one of the users is offline, as soon as they come online the will 
							receive the self destruct command and it will forcefully clear the database as well. If users 
							are currently online it will also clear sent messages on the screen of each device. This 
							should be reserved for an actual emergency because it is time consuming to recreate and 
							deliver new one-time pads.
