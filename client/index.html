				<h2>Generate pads</h2>
				<div class="information">
					You need truly random data for perfectly secure communication using one-time pads. This program provides a True 
					Random Number Generator (TRNG).<br>
					<br>
					Entropy is extracted from a photograph that you provide. For high quality results, use a photo from a 
					standalone digital camera that has been captured in your camera's raw image format, transferred to 
					your computer by USB cable (or SD card), then losslessly converted to PNG (or BMP) file format. Avoid JPEG 
					and other lossy compression algorithms where possible as they may affect the output in predictable ways. 
					Avoid using your mobile phone as they generally have poor security and the contents can be secretly 
					collected from them at any time due to the closed baseband processor.<br>
					<br>
					Take a photo of something that is generally random in nature. Photos taken in macro mode of sand at a 
					beach, grass and gravel work best. Trees, rocks and ocean waves also work reasonably well. Avoid clouds 
					and studio photography with plain backgrounds.<br>
					<br>
					The program will run randomness tests on the data after it has been run through the randomness extractor. 
					Check that all of the tests pass otherwise you may need to try a different photo. Be sure to delete 
					the original photo after the one-time pads have been created from it. To be extra safe, run this program 
					from a non-networked (air gapped) computer.<br>
					<br>
					This process should be run from a PC as it is very resource intensive and the page is not mobile optimised. 
					The website has details about how the algorithm processes and extracts the random data from the photo.<br>
					<br>
					Alternatively you may import your own truly random data (at your own risk) which will be split it into 
					separate one-time pads for use with the program. Do not use data generated from a PRNG or even a 
					CSPRNG as it will not be strong enough for one-time pads and will reduce the security to that of a 
					stream cipher.
