				<h2>Generate pads</h2>
				<div class="information">
					You need true random data for perfectly secure communication using one-time pads. This program provides a True 
					Random Number Generator (TRNG).<br>
					<br>
					Entropy is extracted from a photograph that you provide. For high quality results, use a photo from a 
					standalone digital camera or DSLR that has been captured in your camera's raw image format and converted to PNG or BMP. 
					Avoid JPEG and other lossy compression algorithms if possible as they may affect the output in predictable ways.<br>
					<br>
					Take a photo of something that is generally random in nature. Photos taken in macro mode of sand at a beach, grass and 
					gravel work best. Trees, rocks and ocean waves work reasonably well. Clouds tend not to work too well. The program will 
					run randomness tests on the raw random data and also after the data has been run through the Von Neumann randomness 
					extractor. Check that both sets of tests pass otherwise you may need to try a different photo. Be sure to delete the 
					photo after the one-time pads have been created from it.<br>
					<br>
					This process should be run from a PC as it is very resource intensive and the page is not mobile optimised. The 
					website has details about how it processes and extracts the photo data.
