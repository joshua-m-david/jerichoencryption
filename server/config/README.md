This directory contains a configuration file `config.php` to configure the server API.

- To edit the valid number of users for this chat group, change the `$numberOfUsers` value. This must be an integer between `2` - `7` inclusive.

- The `$serverKey` is used to sign all data going to or from the server using the Skein-512 hash. This key is ideally generated by the TRNG in the client application and exported for each user with their one-time pads so they can connect to the server to send/receive messages.

- Make sure the server key is random hexadecimal symbols (0-9, a-f) of 128 hexadecimal symbols in length which is a 512 bit key. The client program can generate a truly random 512 bit server key for you. This can be done after the one-time pads have been generated. From there you can copy and paste it into this configuration file.

- You can also change the PostgreSQL database credentials as required.

- If the client is having trouble connecting, try setting the `$testResponseHeaders` value to `true`. This will enable debug messages to be sent back with the responses which are viewable in the browser's development tools.
