					<h1>Client Installation Guide</h1>
					<p>
						There's the easy way and there's the normal way. If your chat partner who set up the server was nice enough, 
						they might have done all the hard work for you and you can follow the easy method, otherwise just follow 
						the normal process.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Easy setup</h2>
					<p>
						Your chat partner should have set up the following for you:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Installed a copy of <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">Firefox Portable</a> on a USB drive 
							and <a href="installation-server.html#securing-new-profile">secured it</a>
						</li>
						<li>Copied the client files and your one-time pads to a directory on the USB drive.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>						
						If these steps have been done then all you need to do is run the <b>firefox.exe</b> application and open 
						the <b>index.html</b> which will open Jericho Comms inside the browser. From there you can 
						<a href="usage.html#loading-pads">load the one-time pads</a> from the text file into the application 
						and start chatting. The <a href="usage.html">Usage guide</a> has more information if 
						you need it. Remember to erase the text file containing the one-time pads after you have loaded them into 
						the program. The program will automatically erase the corresponding one-time pad after each message has 
						been sent and received.						
					</p>
					
					<h2>Normal setup</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Install prerequisite software first which is the latest version of 
							<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop">Firefox</a> or 
							<a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a>. One of these browsers are needed as most other 
							browsers do not have native support for some of the 
							<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/">HTML5 technologies</a> this program uses. The other advantage 
							is they are open source. Do not use the closed source Google Chrome, Opera or Internet Explorer. You 
							cannot trusted closed source software in today's world given the recent NSA leaks.
						</li>
						<li>
							Follow the steps listed for <a href="installation-server.html#setup-secure-profile">setting up a new browser profile</a> 
							and <a href="installation-server.html#securing-new-profile">securing the profile</a>. 
						</li>
						<li>
							You should have a copy of the server's self-signed TLS certificate file. Follow 
							<a href="installation-server.html#importing-certificate">these steps</a> to install it into the browser. Alternatively you 
							can verify the certificate's MD5 and SHA1 hashes in the browser when you attempt to connect to the server address. The 
							person who generated the certificate on the server should be able to tell you the correct hashes.
						</li>
						<li>Download the files from one of the mirrors listed on the <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</li>
						<li>
							Verify the file hashes and signature from the <a href="download.html">download page</a>. It is absolutely critical to 
							verify the downloaded file with one of the hashes or signatures. This is to prevent the NSA or other 3 letter agencies 
							from modifying the source code which could weaken/break the encryption and then distributing those copies around the 
							internet pretending to be the real thing. You can verify the hashes with standalone  
							<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/hash-calculator-to-get-compute-and-calculate-md5-and-sha1-file-checksum-or-hash-value/">tools for Windows</a> or
							<a href="installation-server.html#verify-signature">basic Linux console commands</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Extract the files from the archive to your desired location. Windows users can use the free 
							<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> program for this. Linux users can run the following command 
							to extract the files to the current directory which you can then copy to wherever you want:<br>
							<code>tar -zxvf jericho-v1.5.tar.gz</code><br>
							<br>
							Or alternatively use this to extract to a pre-existing directory of your choice:<br>
							<code>tar -zxvf jericho-v1.5.tar.gz -C /path/to/directory</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							Open the <b>client</b> directory then open <b>index.html</b> in your web browser (Firefox or Chromium). 
							You can continue with the <a href="usage.html">How to use</a> guide from now on.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Extra precautions</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Ideally you should <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/tutorial">create a TrueCrypt container</a> (using all 3 encryption 
							algorithms) and extract the files directly into there first if you are intending on running the client locally on the machine.
							This slows down the process of recovering the pads from the hard drive by 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics">forensic analysis</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Also a portable copy of <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">Firefox</a> or 
							<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable">Chrome</a> should be put inside the container and 
							the client program run from inside there. This means that the SQLite database used by the browser which stores the 
							one-time pads is always encrypted.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use a MicroSD, SD card or USB memory stick and put the Truecrypt volume containing the client files and portable browser 
							on it. This means you can hide or destroy the memory/device easily in an emergency. It also means you can chat from any 
							computer, so you could take it to work or other places.
						</li>
