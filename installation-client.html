					<h1>Client Installation Guide</h1>
					<p>
						There's the easy way and there's the normal way. If your chat partner who set up the server was nice enough,
						they might have done all the hard work for you and you can follow the easy method, otherwise just follow
						the normal process.
					</p>

					<h2>Easy setup</h2>
					<p>
						Your chat partner should have set up the following for you:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Installed a copy of <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">Firefox Portable</a> on a USB drive
							and <a href="installation-client.html#securing-new-profile">secured it</a>
						</li>
						<li>Copied the client files and your one-time pads to a directory on the USB drive.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						If these steps have been done then all you need to do is run the <b>Firefox</b> application and open
						the <b>index.html</b> which will open Jericho Comms inside the browser. From there you can
						<a href="usage.html#loading-pads">load the one-time pads</a> from the text file into the application
						and start chatting. The <a href="usage.html">Usage guide</a> has more information if
						you need it. Remember to erase the text file containing the one-time pads after you have loaded them into
						the program. The program will automatically erase the corresponding one-time pad after each message has
						been sent and received.
					</p>

					<h2>Normal setup</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Install prerequisite software first which is the latest version of
							<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop">Firefox</a>,
							<a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> or <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>. One of these
							browsers are needed as most other browsers do not have native support for some of the
							<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/">HTML5 technologies</a> this program uses. The other advantage
							is they are open source. Do not use the closed source Google Chrome, Opera or Internet Explorer. You
							cannot trusted closed source software in today's world given the recent NSA leaks.
						</li>
						<li>
							Take note of the steps listed for <a href="#setup-secure-profile">setting up a new browser profile</a>
							and <a href="#securing-new-profile">securing the profile</a>.
						</li>
						<li>Download the files from one of the mirrors listed on the <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</li>
						<li>
							Verify the file hashes and signature from the <a href="download.html">download page</a>. It is absolutely critical to
							verify the downloaded file with one of the hashes or signatures. This is to prevent the NSA or other 3 letter agencies
							from modifying the source code which could weaken/break the encryption and then distributing those copies around the
							internet pretending to be the real thing. You can verify the hashes with standalone
							<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/hash-calculator-to-get-compute-and-calculate-md5-and-sha1-file-checksum-or-hash-value/">tools for Windows</a> or
							<a href="installation-server.html#verify-signature">basic Linux console commands</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Extract the files from the archive to your desired location. Windows users can use the free
							<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> program for this. Linux users can run the following command
							to extract the files to the current directory which you can then copy to wherever you want:<br>
							<code>tar -xvf jericho-v1.5.4.tar.xz</code><br>
							<br>
							Or alternatively use this to extract to a pre-existing directory of your choice:<br>
							<code>tar -xvf jericho-v1.5.4.tar.xz -C /path/to/directory</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							Open the <b>client</b> directory then open <b>index.html</b> in your web browser (Firefox or Chromium).
							You can continue with the <a href="usage.html">How to use</a> guide from now on.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Extra precautions</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Ideally you should <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/tutorial">create a TrueCrypt container</a> (using all 3 encryption
							algorithms) and extract the files directly into there first if you are intending on running the client locally on the machine.
							This slows down the process of recovering the pads from the hard drive by
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics">forensic analysis</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Also a portable copy of <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">Firefox</a> or
							<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable">Chrome</a> should be put inside the container and
							the client program run from inside there. This means that the SQLite database used by the browser which stores the
							one-time pads is always encrypted.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use a MicroSD, SD card or USB memory stick and put the Truecrypt volume containing the client files and portable browser
							on it. This means you can hide or destroy the memory/device easily in an emergency. It also means you can chat from any
							computer, so you could take it to work or other places.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="setup-secure-profile">Setup a new secure browser profile</h2>
					<p>
						In this step we will setup a new secure browser or browser profile purely for secure communications. This
						is mainly because it's handy to have a separate profile so you don't accidentally erase your one-time pads
						whenever you clear your browser history. It also keeps this profile and extensions separate so nothing
						can maliciously copy your one-time pads. An extra layer of security would be to install the browser/browser
						profile into an <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/tutorial">encrypted volume</a>,
						so it's encrypted on the storage device as well.<br>
						<br>
						For portability you can download the latest version of Firefox Portable
						<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">from here</a> and install it. If you want
						to chat from multiple computers, install it onto a USB drive. There exists portable
						versions of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/crportable/">Chromium</a> as well but
						this guide will just cover Firefox for now.
					</p>
					<h3>Alternate method</h3>
					<p>
						If you just want to use your existing Firefox install you can follow
						<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_Manager">these instructions</a> to set up a new profile.
						The <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Opening_a_new_instance_of_Firefox_with_another_profile">-no-remote</a> option
						may come in handy when you want to run multiple separate Firefox profiles at the same time.
					</p>

					<h2 id="securing-new-profile">Securing your new Firefox profile</h2>
					<p>
						This section follows some steps to lock down your browser profile so it is as secure as possible
						and will only be used for chatting with this program.
					</p>

					<h3>Disabling default plugins in the browser</h3>
					<p>
						Now we will disable all the default browser plugins as they are not required and are a potential security hole.<br>
						<br>
						Open the <b>Firefox</b> main menu then click on <b>Add-ons</b><br>
						<br>
						<img class="listImage" src="img/firefox-addon-menu.png"><br>
						<br>
						Then click on <b>Plugins</b> in the left side menu. For every plugin change the option to <b>Never Activate</b>:<br>
						<br>
						<img class="listImage" src="img/firefox-plugins.jpg"><br>
						<br>
						Restart the browser for all the changes to take effect. That covers the basic steps to secure the browser profile. If you have
						set this up on a portable Firefox install, be sure to copy that install for the other user onto a USB drive so they don't need
						to repeat the process.
